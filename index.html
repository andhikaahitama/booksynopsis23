<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Loose Leaf for Exploring Earth Science</h2><p>Exploring Earth Science, Second Edition, by Stephen Reynolds and Julia Johnson, is an innovative textbook intended for an introductory college geology course, such as earth science. This ground-breaking, visually spectacular book was designed following cognitive and educational research on how students think, learn, and study.<br>Nearly all information in the book is built around 2,600 photographs and stunning illustrations, rather than long blocks of text. These annotated illustrations help students visualize geologic processes and concepts, and are suited to the way most instructors already teach. To alleviate cognitive load and enable students to focus on one important geologic process or concept at a time, the book consists entirely of two-page spreads organized into 20 chapters. Each chapter is a learning cycle, which begins with a visually engaging two-page spread about a compelling geologic issue. Each two-page spread is a self-contained block of information about a specific topic, emphasizing geologic concepts, processes, features, and approaches. These spreads help students learn and organize geologic knowledge in a new and exciting way. Each chapter ends with an &#x201c;Investigation&#x201d; that challenges students with a problem associated with a virtual place.<br>Inquiry is embedded throughout the book, modeling how scientists investigate problems. The title of each two-page spread and topic heading is a question intended to prompt readers to think about the topic and become interested and motivated to explore further for answers. Most two-page spreads contain a Before You Leave This Page checklist that highlights what is important and what is expected of students before they move on. This list contains learning objectives for the spread and provides a clear way for the instructor to indicate to the student what is important. The items on these lists are compiled into a master What-to-Know List provided to instructors, so they can delete or add entries to suit learning goals and to distribute to students before they begin reading the book.<br>New to This Edition� The entire text has been significantly revised for clarity and concision.� Every chapter incorporates significant additions and improvements, including new photographs, revised figures, and reorganization.&nbsp;� New fonts improve readability on portable electronic devices.� More than 180 new photographs represent a wider geographic diversity and provide more detail and clarity about various processes and features, whether on land, in the atmosphere, or in the water.� The text includes new and revised figures.� New spreads and information focus on sedimentary environments and impact craters and revised coverage on climate change.� The text reflects new ideas and provides new data on topics such as Pluto, comets, satellite temperatures, and sea-level rise.� Text boxes are numbered to guides student to read in a specific order.McGraw-Hill Education's Connect (available as an optional, add-on item) is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver just what they need, when they need it, and how they need it, so that class time is more effective. Connect allows the professor to assign homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student's work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers and also may have a multistep solution to guide students' learning along if they experience difficulty.</p><p>Julia K.

The lessons for the United States in Iraq are many. . . . Washington should take note: this book is a sober and valuable warning of how difficult that struggle can be.&#x201d;&#x2015;Eric Pape, <i>Newsweek</i><br>&#x201c;Drawing on new archival sources and interviews, Mr. Gottesman fills a gap, describing a shadowy period in Cambodia&#x2019;s recent history, a period as crucial as the more thoroughly explored Khmer Rouge interregnum.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michael J. Ybarra, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p><b>Evan Gottesman</b> spent three years in Cambodia, where he served as resident liaison and deputy director of the American Bar Association Cambodia Law and Democracy Project."The most recent book on the Cambodian tragedy makes an important claim; that the Vietnamese occupation was essentially doomed because of events inside the country, and not very much because of the outside allegiance ranged against it. It is an extreme view, but Evan Gottesman does his best to back it up with important new research and background gained during a three-year effort to help build post-1978 Cambodia. . . . His book is a wonderful book, the best yet, at the struggles of nation building and the toll it takes, until one man finally emerges from the contenders. . . . In light of January's riots, encouraged and spurred on by certain Cambodian politicians, this account of how Hun Sen got to the top on little but sheer will and ruthlessness is timely."&#x2014;Alan Dawson, Bangkok Post<br><br><br>"A painstaking look, both sober and sobering, at the slow rebuilding process and the old hatreds that impede it."&#x2014;George Fetherling, Vancouver Sun<br></p><h2>Scenes from the Life of Jesus Christ: A Three-Dimensional Bible Storybook</h2><p>Pop-up depictions of the Nativity, parables, the entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, and the Resurrection are accompanied by relevent passages adapted from the King James Bible</p><p></p><h2>Bring Out Your Dead: The Past as Revelation</h2><p>The work of the Renaissance humanists comes to life in Anthony Grafton&#x2019;s exploration of the primary sources and modern scholarship, classical and modern elements in the world of European letters from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century.<br>Tracing the ties that bound the world of humanistic learning in early modern Europe to other social and cultural spheres, Grafton defines the current state of the art of scholarship on early modern European cultural and intellectual history while simultaneously demonstrating how entertaining, enlightening, and relevant that history can be.<br>Covering a dazzling variety of topics and authors as different as Alberti and Descartes, Grafton maps the grand and meticulous efforts of the past to connect the realm of nature with that of books, the realm of everyday experience with that of passionate reading in massive tomes, and the realm of codes of etiquette and institutions with that of extravagant and joyous erudition&#x2015;efforts that this book itself brilliantly carries on.</p><p>Anthony Grafton, Henry Putnam University Professor of History and the Humanities at Princeton University, is the author of <i>The Footnote: A Curious History, Defenders of the Text, Christianity and the Transformation of the Book,</i> and <i>Forgers and Critics,</i> among other books. He writes regularly for the <i>New York Review of Books</i>.&#x201c;<i>Bring Out Your Dead</i> is the latest collection of essays by Anthony Grafton, our most prolific and engaging scholar of early modern European thought. Here are reflections on humanism, the ancient city, the critical reception of the celebrated 'Dinner at Trimalchio' section of Petronius's <i>Satyricon</i>, the editing and publication of classical texts, Vico's <i>New Science</i> (which influenced Joyce) and much else. Many of these pieces were originally reviews or introductions, but to read even the most casual of Grafton's lucubrations is deeply rewarding: a civilized mind meditating on the nature of scholarship and learning in the West.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Grafton explores the intellectual life of the Renaissance humanists, arguing that they did not work in a vacuum but rather interacted with one another and with the architects, sculptors, painters, and political theorists of their day. The result was a real intellectual community that belies the myth of the humanist scholar as solitary figure ensconced in a study surrounded by classical texts.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert J. Andrews</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Many of the scholars who between the 15th century and the 19th recovered the ancient world and created the disciplines of modern learning were weird. And no one captures their grit, brawling and glory like Anthony Grafton. Or with such humor; I can't think of another intellectual historian of his stature who would give a book a title that invokes, among other jokes, a classic <i>Monty Python</i> scene... [Grafton's] passion is for understanding and, as he confronts its pioneers who are themselves responding sharply to ancient and contemporary writers, the polyphonic conversation becomes a discourse about how we have become who we are. Like the contentious people in his book, he wants to leave behind students who are in love with discovery. May they absorb his eloquence and his quick, tough earthiness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>D. J. R. Bruckner</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Anthony Grafton prefers the 'brighter side' of the European Renaissance. He does not spend much time harping on about all those evil '-isms' revisionist historians complain were also aboard that leaky old flagship of western civilization. Instead, in this, his latest of more than 20 witty and jargon-free books, Grafton enthusiastically examines one of the more worthy -isms&#x2015;humanism, which enjoyed both innocent cause and generous effect on world culture... In <i>Bring Out Your Dead</i>, Grafton traces the evolution of Latin humanism from its archaeological and antiquarian beginnings in Italy, through its emphasis on rhetoric and sometimes pedantic exercise across the Alps (especially in the Germanic lands), and then to its unexpected influence on the rise of enlightened scientific and historical reasoning by the 18th century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Samuel Edgerton</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Grafton's own contribution to this tradition has been fourfold. First, his research on Scaliger has given him firsthand knowledge of many of the most remote and demanding branches of humanist learning. Secondly, his omnivorous curiosity and astonishing energy have made him uniquely well-acquainted with the bibliography, ancient and modern, of huge tracts of learning. Thirdly, he has done more than his predecessors to bring the history of scholarship into the mainstream and to relate it to the broader history of social and cultural change. Finally, and perhaps most important, he is a superb expositor. He writes with such wit, eloquence, and baroque exuberance, and his prose is so free from obfuscating academic jargon, that he succeeds in engaging the reader's interest in what would otherwise seem impossibly arcane subject matter... Anthony Grafton [is] one of the outstanding historians of our time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Keith Thomas</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This mischievously titled book is a collection of eighteen essays, or rather a learned miscellany that deals with the history of historians of scholarship in the Renaissance and Early Modern period. Students who dip into its pages will be delighted to find that wholesale borrowing, plagiarism, pastiche, misattribution and even imposture have a venerable history in academic life. Anthony Grafton's lucid, witty and often allusive prose brings to life not only a pantheon of eccentric individuals, but in keeping with the promise of the title makes the stuff of intellectual endeavour exciting... Studies on the history of early print culture are multiplying, but I found Grafton's summary of the explosion of printed material and the changes in readers' tastes (such as the decline in Latin publications after 1700) a clear and concise guide to the 'communicative shifts' in Early Modern Europe... This is a book no scholar of the period should be without.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dosia Reichardt</b><b>, </b><b><i>Parergon</i></b></p><h2>Simulation Modeling and Analysis with Expertfit Software</h2><p>Since the publication of the first edition in 1982, the goal of Simulation Modeling and Analysis has always been to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art, and technically correct treatment of all important aspects of a simulation study. The book strives to make this material understandable by the use of intuition and numerous figures, examples, and problems. It is equally well suited for use in university courses, simulation practice, and self study. The book is widely regarded as the &#x201c;bible&#x201d; of simulation and now has more than 100,000 copies in print. The book can serve as the primary text for a variety of courses; for example: <p> � A first course in simulation at the junior, senior, or beginning-graduate-student level in engineering, manufacturing, business, or computer science (Chaps. 1 through 4, and parts of Chaps. 5 through 9). At the end of such a course, the students will be prepared to carry out complete and effective simulation studies, and to take advanced simulation courses. </p><p> � A second course in simulation for graduate students in any of the above disciplines (most of Chaps. 5 through 12). After completing this course, the student should be familiar with the more advanced methodological issues involved in a simulation study, and should be prepared to understand and conduct simulation research. </p><p> � An introduction to simulation as part of a general course in operations research or management science (part of Chaps. 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9).</p></p><p>Averill Law is President of Averill M.

In this challenging review of the field, leading disability academic and activist Tom Shakespeare argues that the social model theory has reached a dead end. </p> <p>Drawing on a critical realist perspective, Shakespeare promotes a pluralist, engaged and nuanced approach to disability. Key topics discussed include:</p> <ul> <li>dichotomies - the dangerous polarizations of medical model versus social model, impairment versus disability and disabled people versus non-disabled people </li> <li>identity - the drawbacks of the disability movement's emphasis on identity politics </li> <li>bioethics in disability - choices at the beginning and end of life and in the field of genetic and stem cell therapies </li> <li>care and social relationships - questions of intimacy and friendship. </li></ul> <p>This stimulating and accessible book challenges orthodoxies in British disability studies, promoting a new conceptualization of disability and fresh research agenda. It is an invaluable resource for researchers and students in disability studies and sociology, as well as professionals, policy makers and activists.</p></p><p><p>Tom Shakespeare has taught and researched sociology at the Universities of Cambridge, Sunderland, Leeds and Newcastle. He has written and broadcast extensively about disability and genetics, and his co-authored books include <em>The Sexual Politics of Disability, Exploring Disability</em> and <em>Genetic Politics</em>. </p><p><strong>'Tom Shakespeare has produced a work of mature scholarship that advances our thinking about the fundamental issues in Disability Studies. The clarity and balance of his argument challenges others to raise the level of discourse in the field. <em>Disability Rights and Wrongs</em> is a must read.'</strong> - <em>Gary L. Albrecht, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA</em></p> <p><strong>'In his characteristically polemical and thought-provoking style, Tom Shakespeare presents a call to arms against the British social model of disability. Love it or loathe it, there is much in this book to stimulate debate in disability studies and the wider social science community. The reader is taken into familiar territory as well as into areas little explored in disability studies to date. Challenges are thrown up at every turn. Do Shakespeare&#x2019;s arguments hold up? You be the judge.'</strong> - <em>Carol Thomas, Institute for Health Research, Lancaster University, UK</em></p> <p><strong>'Galileo was roundly condemned for daring to question the orthodoxy of the day, even though he was right. Tom Shakespeare also challenges orthodoxy concerning disability theory and studies. No cow is sacred and as a result this book will be controversial. But his arguments demand consideration and deep thought. If you read only one book on disability rights this year, make this the book.'</strong> - <em>Bert Massie, Disability Rights Commission, UK</em></p> <p><strong>'This thought-provoking and interesting book challenges conventional views in relation to disability studies...a valuable resource to students of disability studies, practitioners as well as other professionals who work with disabled people.'</strong> <em>- Angela Clarke, Therapy Today</em></p> <p></p></p><h2>Greek for the Rest of Us</h2><p>You don&#39;t have to be a Greek student to understand biblical Greek. If you&#39;d love to learn Greek so you can study your Bible better, but you can&#39;t spare two years for college or seminary courses, then Greek for the Rest of Us is for you. Developed by renowned Greek teacher William Mounce, this revolutionary crash-course on &#39;baby Greek&#39; will acquaint you with the essentials of the language and deepen your understanding of God&#39;s Word. You&#39;ll gain a sound knowledge of basic Greek, and you&#39;ll learn how to use tools that will add muscle to your Bible studies. In six sections, Greek for the Rest of Us will help you: - Recite the Greek alphabet - Read and pronounce Greek words - Learn the Greek noun and verbal system - Conduct Greek word studies - Decipher why translations are different - Read better commentaries Greek for the Rest of Us broadens your knowledge still further with an appendix on biblical Hebrew. It also includes a CD-ROM for your computer featuring the author&#39;s class lectures in audio, combined with text and overheads.</p><p>William D Mounce (Ph.D., Aberdeen University) lives as a writer in Washougal, Washington. He is the President of BiblicalTraining.org, a non-profit organization offering world-class educational resources for discipleship in the local church. See www.BillMounce.com for more information. Formerly he was a preaching pastor, and prior to that a professor of New Testament and director of the Greek Program at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He is the author of the bestselling Greek textbook, Basics of Biblical Greek, and many other resources. He was the New Testament chair of the English Standard Version translation of the Bible, and is serving on the NIV translation committee.</p><h2>A History of Islamic Spain</h2><p><p>The period of Muslim occupation in Spain represents the only significant contact Islam and Europe was ever to have on European soil. In this important as well as fascinating study, Watt traces Islam's influence upon Spain and European civilization--from the collapse of the Visigoths in the eighth century to the fall of Granada in the fifteenth, and considers Spain's importance as a part of the Islamic empire. Particular attention is given to the golden period of economic and political stability achieved under the Umayyads.</p> <p>Without losing themselves in detail and without sacrificing complexity, the authors discuss the political, social, and economic continuity in Islamic Spain, or al-Andalus, in light of its cultural and intellectual effects upon the rest of Europe. Medieval Christianity, Watt points out, found models of scholarship in the Islamic philosophers and adapted the idea of holy war to its own purposes while the final reunification of Spain under the aegis of the Reconquista played a significant role in bringing Europe out of the Middle Ages. A survey essential to anyone seeking a more complete knowledge of European or Islamic history, the volume also includes sections on literature and philology by Pierre Cachia.</p> <p>This series of "Islamic surveys" is designed to give the educated reader something more than can be found in the usual popular books. Each work undertakes to survey a special part of the field, and to show the present stage of scholarship here. Where there is a clear picture this will be given; but where there are gaps, obscurities and differences of opinion, these will also be indicated. Full and annotated bibliographies will afford guidance to those who want to pursue their studies further. There will also be some account of the nature and extent of the source material. The series is addressed in the first place to the educated reader, with little or no previous knowledge of the subject; its character is such that it should be of value also to university students and others whose interest is of a more professional kind.</p></p><p><p> <i>W.

Now, in Kirinyaga, Resnick presents the haunting and utterly compelling tale of one man's utopia.<br><br>By the twentieth second century in the African nation of Kenya, polluted cities sprawl up the flanks of sacred Mount Kirinyaga. Great animal herds are but distant memories. European crops now grow on the sweeping savannas. But Koriba, a distinguished, educated man of Kikuyu ancestry, knows that life was different for his people centuries ago--and he is determined to build a utopian colony, not on earth, but on the terraformed planetoid he proudly names Kirinyaga.<br><br>As the mundumugu--witch doctor--Koriba leads the colonists. Reinstating the ancient customs and stringent laws of the Kikuyu people, he alone decides their fate. He must face many challenges to the struggling colony's survival: from a brilliant young girl whose radiant intellect could threaten their traditional ways to the interference of "Maintenance" which holds the power to revoke the colony's charter. All the while, only Koriba--unbeknownst to his people--maintains the computer link to the rest of humanity.<br><br>Ironically, the Kirinyaga experiment threatens to collapse--not from violence or greed--but from humankind's insatiable desire for knowledge. The Kikuyu people can no more stand still in time than their planet can stop revolving around its sun.<br><br>Deeply moving, swiftly paced, and profound in its implications, Kirinyaga is Mike Resnick's most triumphant work to date. His Fable of Utopia is the book every science fiction reader will want to own and savor for years to come.</p><p><i>Kirinyaga: A Fable of Utopia</i> collects Mike Resnick's famous Kirinyaga stories and ties them together in a thematic arc that has novel-like continuity. The story focuses on Koriba, a <i>mundumugu</i> (sort of like a witch doctor and a wise man rolled into one) of the Kikuyu tribe. Koriba feels that his tribe has been corrupted by "European" technology, so he helps to establish a small, utopian planetoid named Kirinyaga where the Kikuyu can return to their roots, farming the land and worshipping the god Ngai without technological or cultural interference. As utopias go, Kirinyaga experiences its fair share of problems--both from within and without--each of which is detailed in the individual chapters and stories. The writing is not stylish but the stories are all excellent, and Resnick does a good job of integrating the traditional Kikuyu way of life into tales that any culture can appreciate. Readers looking for a novel may come away a bit disappointed because this book is really a collection of stories, but as far as collections go, few are better than <i>Kirinyaga</i>.The first time I read Mike Resnick's Kirinyaga, I was sitting on my back<br>patio on a blazing summer afternoon. Instantly, he transported me to<br>another hot world light years from mine. It was a harsh, untamed place<br>where men and women had rejected Western ways and chosen to live in the<br>manner of their Kikuyu ancestors.<br><br>The story Mike tells of the colony and the man who founded it is forever<br>etched in my mind. Before this, I'd known his work by reputation, but had<br>never had the chance to read something of his. After Kirinyaga, though,<br>there's no questions he's got me hooked. I can't wait to see what he comes<br>up with next.<br><p>--Amy Stout, Consulting Editor</p></p><h2>Angels: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>In this lively and concise <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, David Albert Jones provides a crisp, broad-ranging survey of angels in theology, philosophy, and popular culture. Focusing on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, he examines how angels have been imagined and explained as well as why they continue to captivate us. Jones explores the classical discussion--what they are made of, when they came to be, and how many there are. He names the archangels, surveys the different hierarchies, and examines how they have changed over time. He looks at why the idea of angels remains so potent in modern culture, even among non-believers.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Albert Jones</strong> is the Academic Director in the School of Theology, Philosophy, and History at St Mary's University College, Twickenham.<br>*Starred Review* Noting that angels figure in today&#x2019;s so-called New Age religions as well as the three great monotheisms, Jones discusses angels in art, literature, and cinema but also answers the most basic questions (e.g., What is an angel?) while trying to understand what makes angels so appealing and symbolically powerful in modern culture. He reveals how the concept of the angel developed and explains angels&#x2019; characteristic as messengers, guardians, and fallen angels. He discusses angels in biblical stories (e.g., Jacob&#x2019;s ladder) and in liturgy, ventures an intelligent guess as to the number of angels, and even confronts the age-old question of how many can dance on the head of a pin. He addresses the issue of fallen angels and the notion of Satanism and romantic rebellion. Finally, he examines the meaning of angels in religion and pop culture. A persistent theme is, as he puts it, &#x201c;angelology as disguised anthropology&#x201d;&#x2014;the interpretation of angels to procure useful insights into aspects of humanity.

It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates, narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the sun (508b&#x2013;509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509d&#x2013;511e). All three are characterized in relation to dialectic at the end of Books VII and VIII (531d&#x2013;534e). Plato has Socrates describe a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality. Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all, for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the manufactured reality that is the shadows seen by the prisoners. The inmates of this place do not even desire to leave their prison; for they know no better life. The prisoners manage to break their bonds one day, and discover that their reality was not what they thought it was. They discovered the sun, which Plato uses as an analogy for the fire that man cannot see behind. Like the fire that cast light on the walls of the cave, the human condition is forever bound to the impressions that are received through the senses. Even if these interpretations (or, in Kantian terminology, intuitions) are an absurd misrepresentation of reality, we cannot somehow break free from the bonds of our human condition - we cannot free ourselves from phenomenal state just as the prisoners could not free themselves from their chains. If, however, we were to miraculously escape our bondage, we would find a world that we could not understand - the sun is incomprehensible for someone who has never seen it. In other words, we would encounter another "realm", a place incomprehensible because, theoretically, it is the source of a higher reality than the one we have always known; it is the realm of pure Form, pure fact. Socrates remarks that this allegory can be paired with previous writings, namely the analogy of the sun and the analogy of the divided line.</p><p>Plato</p><h2>Intervention!: The United States and the Mexican Revolution, 1913-1917</h2><p>Powerful and compelling. . . Eisenhower is not only an accomplished military historian, he&#39;s also a storyteller in the tradition of Bruce Caton and Shelby Foote.&#34; -Steve Neal, Chicago Sun-Times In May 1916, six American soldiers led by Lieutenant George S. Patton, Jr., surrounded a building near Rubio, Chihuahua. When the occupants burst out of the door, guns blazing, Patton and his men cut them down. A month later seventy American troopers charged into a strong Mexican position at Carrizal; ten were killed and twenty-three taken prisoner. In 1914, a powerful American naval force seized Mexico&#39;s principal seaport, Veracruz, and occupied the city for six months. Yet, all the while, Mexico and the United States were technically at peace. The United States began its involvement in the Mexican Revolution in 1913 with President Woodrow Wilson&#39;s decision to remove Victoriana Huerta, leader of a military junta that overthrew and murdered Mexico&#39;s president, Francisco Madero. Diplomatic actions failing, Wilson occupied Veracruz, cutting off Huerta&#39;s supplies of arms from abroad. When in 1916 the legendary bandit Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico, Wilson sent General John J. Pershing into Chihuahua to capture him. This story leads readers to increased respect for the people of Mexico and its revolutionary leaders-Zapata, Obregon, Carranza, and Pancho Villa. It shows that, while American troops performed well, U.S. intervention had no effect on the outcome of the Mexican Revolution. The American army had a taste of battle and Pershing went on to become the greatest American hero of the First World War.</p><p>This history of the United States&#39;s meddling in Mexican affairs features a cast of characters who don&#39;t make either side look very good. President Woodrow Wilson regularly misapprehends the situation to his south, prompting two violations of Mexican sovereignty: a naval occupation of Veracruz and an aggressive search by the American military for the bandit Pancho Villa, who raided a town in New Mexico. The Mexican politicians were hardly exemplars of democratic enlightenment, but the American response to their shenanigans sparked an enormous amount of national indignation in Mexico that still hasn&#39;t entirely vanished. Brigadier General John J. Pershing, the man charged with hunting down Villa, comes across as an upright soldier and one of the book&#39;s few noble figures; he&#39;s the central character in Eisenhower&#39;s most entertaining section.John Eisenhower is the author of several books, including The Bitter Woods, Allies: Pearl Harbor to D-Day, and So Far From God.

Examining such readily observable phenomena, this book introduces readers to the beauty of nature as revealed by mathematics and the beauty of mathematics as revealed in nature.</p><br><p> Generously illustrated, written in an informal style, and replete with examples from everyday life, <i>Mathematics in Nature</i> is an excellent and undaunting introduction to the ideas and methods of mathematical modeling. It illustrates how mathematics can be used to formulate and solve puzzles observed in nature and to interpret the solutions. In the process, it teaches such topics as the art of estimation and the effects of scale, particularly what happens as things get bigger. Readers will develop an understanding of the symbiosis that exists between basic scientific principles and their mathematical expressions as well as a deeper appreciation for such natural phenomena as cloud formations, halos and glories, tree heights and leaf patterns, butterfly and moth wings, and even puddles and mud cracks.</p><br><p> Developed out of a university course, this book makes an ideal supplemental text for courses in applied mathematics and mathematical modeling. It will also appeal to mathematics educators and enthusiasts at all levels, and is designed so that it can be dipped into at leisure.</p></p><p><p>"Have you wondered how rainbows or sand dunes form? Does it puzzle you why drying mud forms polygonally shaped cracks? Can you explain the patterns on a butterfly's wings or how birds fly? In this delightful book, John Adam invites us to question and to share his enthusiasm for developing mathematical models to explore a wide range of everyday natural phenomena. <i>Mathematics in Nature</i> can be used as a text on mathematical modeling or as a book to dip into and encourage us to observe and wonder at the beauty of nature. It has the potential of becoming a classic."--<b>Brian Sleeman, University of Leeds</b></p><p>"This is a book that I will want to keep close to hand so that I will not be stumped by all those seemingly simple yet subtle questions about nature: Why can fleas jump so high? Why is visibility better in rain than in fog? Why does a river meander? How high can trees grow? But it is much more than a compendium of useful facts and explanations. It is the clearest guide I have seen to the art of conceptualizing, simplifying, and modeling natural phenomena--no less than an exegesis on how good quantitative science is done."--<b>Phillip Ball, Consultant Editor, <i>Nature</i></b></p><p>"<i>Mathematics in Nature</i> leads the calculus-literate reader on a vigorous tour of nature's visible patterns--from the radiator-sailed dinosaur Dimetrodon to fracturing of dried mud and ceramic glazes, from the dispersion of rainbows and iridescence of beetles to the pearling of spider silk. Eschewing phenomena that are too small to see or too large to grasp, Adam shows how elementary college mathematics, rigorously applied, can give precise expression to everyday natural phenomena.

But Sauer's book is still the only work to provide not only a narrative of the voyages and of the colonizing ventures that followed them, but also an exploration of their impact on the peoples, the flora, and the fauna of the Americas.<br><br>For Sauer, Columbus was simply "a Genoese of humble birth and small schooling," obstinate and increasingly paranoid. His obsession with gold and the rights he had secured brought the first Spanish venture overseas to the edge of failure. His successors were more competent administrators but continued the quest for riches, destroying the native ecology and the lifestyle of the indigenous peoples. Sauer attempts to show that native Americans had a balanced and highly productive livelihood that gave them abundance, leisure, and satisfaction. This book offers a unique view of the "cultural landscape" Columbus encountered and how it was transformed by the Europeans, establishing a pattern of conquest and settlement that was repeated all over Spanish America.</p><p>What happened from 1942 to 1519, when Columbus and the Spaniards were staking out an American Empire? Carl O. Sauer uses contemporary sources and his authoritative knowledge of land forms, vegetation and ethnography in Latin America to place the history of the early Spanish Main in a fresh context.<b>Carl Ortwin Sauer</b> (1889-1975), until his death, taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where he trained an entire generation of geographers and founded the Berkeley school of cultural geography. <b>Anthony Pagden</b> is a fellow of King's College, Cambridge University.</p><h2>Rarity (Population and Community Biology Series, 13)</h2><p>To say you are writing about rarity is to invite two kinds of response. Either one provokes a discussion of what rarity is, or some comment on the complex� ity of the subject. The objective of this book is to explore the nature of rarity, its complexity if you like, from one particular perspective on what rarity is. Primarily, it is an opportunity to review, to synthesize, and to question. The book is an attempt to draw together a vast body of literature, to extract from it some general principles, and to raise question marks over areas the founda� tions of which appear to be either absent or crumbling. A perusal of prefaces suggests that they often dwell as long upon what a book is not about, as upon what it does concern. True to such a tradition, I should state that this is specifically not a book about conservation, although in some quarters anything about rarity is viewed as something about conser� vation. Nor does it contain more than a passing reference to the undoubtedly important issues of the role of genetics in rarity. Examples have been drawn from a wide variety of taxa. They are, nonethe� less, somewhat depauperate in cases from marine systems. In part this bias results from the unevenness of my familiarity with the literature, in part it perhaps also reflects differences in the questions asked and approaches to the study of communities and assemblages in terrestrial and marine systems.</p><p>Kevin J. Gaston is Professor of Biodiversity and Conservation in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield. He has twenty years of research experience in environmental science, conducting studies both in the UK and overseas on a wide range of topics, including conservation prioritisation, ecosystem services, invasive species, people-wildlife interactions, and urban ecology.<strong>`</strong>This advanced work should be studied by wildlife biologists, conservation biologists, and ecologists.<strong>'</strong> <br> <strong>Choice</strong> <br> <strong>`</strong>Ecologists are fortunate to have such a solid foundation for the ideas and patterns that contribute to our notions and interpretations of rarity.<strong>'</strong> <br> <strong>Ecology</strong> <br> <strong>`</strong>...few population biologists or conservation ecologists can afford not to have this book to hand.

Kate Bates lives in a man&#39;s world. It her dream to own and run her own farm. To fulfill her dreams she must give up everything and start anew.</p><p>Kate Bates is another Gene Stratton-Porter unsung hero in the tradition of Elnora Comstock, of A Girl of the Limberlost, and Freckles and Laddie, of books of the same name. As the youngest child, and female, in a large prosperous farm family, she has been designated as her mother&#39;s helper in old age. Kate finds this unfair since all of the brothers have been given land and the older sisters sent to teacher training. With the help of a nephew and sister-in-law, she defies her parents, becomes a teacher, leaves home. Her real ambition, however, is to own and cultivate a large farm. After rejecting the easy path to her dream, she suffers through a bad marriage but ultimately acquires her land and achieves happiness.Gene Stratton-Porter (1863-1924), American novelist and naturalist, was born on a farm in Indiana and became one of Indiana&#39;s best-known authors. Writing fiction to support her passion for observing natural habitats, she also wrote non-fiction works that extensively dealt with birds, flowers, and other natural wonders. She fought for the conservation of the Limberlost Swamp and took up other cases of public welfare as well. A Girl of the Limberlost (1909) and Freckles (1904) are two of her most famous works.</p><h2>The Iliad</h2><p>War, glory, despair, and mourning: for 2,700 years, the <em>Iliad</em> has gripped listeners and readers with the story of Achilles' anger and Hector's death. It is a tale of many truths, speaking of powerful emotions, the failures of leadership, the destructive power of beauty, the quest for fame, the plight of women, and the cold callous laughter of the gods. Above all, it confronts us with war in all its brutality--and with fleeting images of peace, lovingly drawn, images which punctuate the poem as distant memories, startling comparisons, and doomed aspirations. <br><br>Anthony Verity's elegant and compelling new translation mirrors the directness, power, and dignity of Homer's poetry. Verity captures as well the essential features of oral poetry, such as repeated phrases and scenes, without sounding mannered or archaic, and his remarkably accurate verse hews closely to the original line numbers, which is invaluable for readers wishing to consult the secondary literature. Barbara Graziosi, an authority on Homeric poetry, offers a full introduction that illuminates the composition of the poem, its literary qualities, and the many different contexts in which it was performed and read. In addition, extensive notes offer book-by-book summaries and shed light on difficult words and passages, mythological allusions, references to ancient practices, and geographical names.

The public avidly consumes accounts of real-life homicide cases, and murder fiction is more popular still. Nevertheless, we have only the most rudimentary scientific understanding of who is likely to kill whom and why. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson apply contemporary evolutionary theory to analysis of human motives and perceptions of self-interest, considering where and why individual interests conflict, using well-documented murder cases. This book attempts to understand normal social motives in murder as products of the process of evolution by natural selection. They note that the implications for psychology are many and profound, touching on such matters as parental affection and rejection, sibling rivalry, sex differences in interests and inclinations, social comparison and achievement motives, our sense of justice, lifespan developmental changes in attitudes, and the phenomenology of the self. This is the first volume of its kind to analyze homicides in the light of a theory of interpersonal conflict. Before this study, no one had compared an observed distribution of victim-killer relationships to &#34;expected&#34; distribution, nor asked about the patterns of killer-victim age disparities in familial killings. This evolutionary psychological approach affords a deeper view and understanding of homicidal violence.</p><p><p>Martin Daly is professor emeritus of psychology, neuroscience and behavior at McMaster University.

This definitive collection, back in print at last, includes such noted essays as &#34;The War and the Intellectuals,&#34; &#34;The Fragment of the State,&#34; &#34;The Development of Public Opinion,&#34; and &#34;John Dewey&#39;s Philosophy.&#34; Bourne&#39;s critique of militarism and advocacy of cultural pluralism are enduring contributions to social and political thought, sure to have an equally strong impact in our own time. In their introduction and preface, Olaf Hansen and Christopher Lasch provide biographical and historical context for Bourne&#39;s work.</p><p><b>Randolph Bourne</b> (1886-1918) studied with Charles Beard and John Dewey at Columbia University.

Following a tantalizing trail of archaeological, chemical, artistic, and textual clues, Patrick E. McGovern, the leading authority on ancient alcoholic beverages, brings us up to date on what we now know about the creation and history of alcohol, and the role of alcohol in society across cultures. Along the way, he integrates studies in food and sociology to explore a provocative hypothesis about the integral role that spirits have played in human evolution. We discover, for example, that the cereal staples of the modern world were probably domesticated in agrarian societies for their potential in fermenting large quantities of alcoholic beverages. These include the delectable rice wines of China and Japan, the corn beers of the Americas, and the millet and sorghum drinks of Africa. Humans also learned how to make mead from honey and wine from exotic fruits of all kinds: even from the sweet pulp of the cacao (chocolate) fruit in the New World. The perfect drink, it turns out-whether it be mind-altering, medicinal, a religious symbol, liquid courage, or artistic inspiration-has not only been a profound force in history, but may be fundamental to the human condition itself. This coffee table book will sate the curiosity of any armchair historian interested in the long history of food and wine.</p><p>"Patrick McGovern has written his masterpiece.

Companies need to be adaptable, flexible, speedy, creative, innovative and opportunistic. In short, they need to act in an entrepreneurial manner. <i>Corporate Entrepreneurship</i> is about the ability of a large organization to make the most of commercial opportunities, to innovate, to do things differently. It is about developing an organizational and strategic capability to not just manage change, but to embrace and action it. Paul Burns' innovative text considers the personal qualities of successful entrepreneurs and the manner in which they do business. He then demonstrates how these qualities can be replicated to form an organizational architecture that encourages entrepreneurship at all levels within a company. <i>Corporate Entrepreneurship</i> pulls together many themes (from leadership, culture, creativity, innovation, strategy, and marketing) in a coherent and accessible form.</p><p>PAUL BURNS is Professor of Entrepreneurship and Dean of the University of Luton Business School, UK. He has previously held posts as Professor of Small Business Development at Cranfield School of Management, UK, having joined it from Warwick University Business School, UK. He also formerly served as Director of the 3i European Enterprise Research Centre, researching small firms across Europe. He has been a Visiting Fellow at Harvard Business School, USA, and a Visiting Professor at the Open University Business School, UK, where he developed the multi-media Small Business Programme which was screened on BBC2. He is Fellow and a former President of the Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (ISBE). He is a chartered accountant, having worked for Arthur Andersen in London. For four years, he ran his own firm, Design for Learning Ltd."Paul Burns' <i>Corporate Entrepreneurship</i> combines an outstanding command of theory and a deep appreciation of managerial practice. The book covers the major challenges managers face in building and maintaining entrepreneurial organizations that are capable of change and innovation. Well written and well grounded in today's market realities, the book presents a lively discussion of effective ways to transform stagnant organizations into entrepreneurial entities that welcome and thrive on change. I am especially impressed with the diversity of the industries and companies covered in the book, the managerial skills analyzed and the wealth of practical guidance Burns offers today's managers.

Together, they ensure the heart of the Concept beats on by promoting collaborative decision-making with the patient at centre and emphasizing the art and science of observation, listening, palpation and movement skills.</p> <p>A key feature of the new edition focuses on a more evidence-based and analytical view of the role of mobilization and manipulation in clinical practice. The authors have written in a way that reflects their application of the Maitland Concept and how they have integrated techniques in the light of advancement in professional knowledge. Each chapter stands alone as a &#x2018;master class&#x2019;.</p> <p>The text is systematically arranged focusing on detailed assessment, clinical reasoning and re-assessment to determine the physical dysfunction and efficacy of manipulative physiotherapy techniques, while also advocating continuous communication and interaction. Techniques of passive mobilization are also described, specifically designed around the individual patient&#x2019;s condition.</p> <p>All the chapters are written from a clinical perspective and review the evidence which informs how to deal with and manage peripheral joint pain as they present to the practitioner. Furthermore, each peripheral region (craniomandibular, upper limbs and lower limbs) is considered from the point of view of best practice in analysing and hypothesising subjective data, examination, treatment and management of peripheral pain conditions.</p> <p>Brand new to the fifth edition is the addition of a companion website &#x2013; Maitland&#x2019;s Manipulation eResources (www.maitlandsresources.com) &#x2013; providing access to a range of valuable learning materials which include videos, MCQs, interactive case studies, research links, and bonus chapters. </p> <p>"Overall this text would be an excellent resource to any practising physiotherapist or health professional within musculoskeletal and orthopaedics from the new graduate to the experienced clinician." <b>Tracy Ward, Senior Physiotherapist and Clinical Pilates Specialist, BMI Healthcare Albyn Hospital, Aberdeen, Oct 14</b></p><ul><li>World-leading experts provide evidence relating the Maitland Concept to clinical practice</li><li>Evidence supporting practice</li><li>Covers both subjective and physical examination</li><li>Best practice management using mobilization and manipulation</li><li>Case studies &#x2013; how and when to integrate the Maitland Concept into clinical practice</li><li>Chapter-based learning outcomes, keywords and glossaries </li><li>Companion website &#x2013; Maitland&#x2019;s Manipulation eResources (www.maitlandsresources.com) </li></ul><ul><li>Expert perspectives and supporting evidence</li><li>Case studies</li><li>Companion website &#x2013; www.maitlandsresources.com &#x2013; containing:</li> <ul><li>Video Bank of over 480 video clips showing examination and treatment techniques</li><li>Image Bank of over 1,000 illustrations</li><li>Interactive case studies</li><li>Over 200 MCQs</li><li>Bonus chapters on additional principles and techniques of examination / treatment</li><li>Weblink references to abstracts</li></ul> </ul></p><p><p>"The fifth edition of this text returns with several updated and additional features. As per previous editions it is the collaboration of international experts within the field of the Maitland Concept. The layout reflects their application of the Maitland Concept, detailing evidence-based practise, clinical reasoning and the integration of the Maitland techniques of passive mobilisations. Chapters are not technique driven, but rather entail the whole approach with the patient&#x2019;s needs at the primary focus.</p> <p>The book begins with an overview of the Maitland Concept as a clinical practise framework and its evidence-based practise, giving the reader the basis of this method of thinking and setting the scene of the following chapters. The main body then it goes on to provide a "masterclass" for each of the major peripheral joints including the craniomandibular, shoulder and shoulder girdle, elbow, wrist and hand, hip, knee, and foot and ankle joints. </p> <p>Chapters are systematically organised covering the subjective history, latest up-to-date evidence, physical examination, treatment techniques and concludes with case studies to demonstrate the practical use of the methods. All chapters begin with a clinical evidence table for each condition associated with that joint. This table is an excellent clinical reasoning tool that demonstrates how each part of your assessment would match symptoms of this condition. Joint anatomy and common conditions are then detailed, as well as conditions not to be missed, or misinterpreted. The rest of the chapter then continues to integrate a strong evidence-base with decision-making provocation interspersed throughout. </p> <p>Although the mobilisation techniques are the central management option within the chapters, the book also supports and enhances other strategies such as recovery of motor control, restoration of normal neurodynamics, physical reconditioning and patient education. Clear diagrams and photographs detail anatomy and manual techniques in adjunct to the text and are accompanied by regular breakout boxes to summarise each section and highlight important facts. </p> <p>The fifth edition is associated for the first time, with a companion website which provides online access to resources including a video and image bank, case studies, multiple choice questions (MCQs) and four bonus chapters. The videos, covering many assessment and treatment techniques, MCQs, and downloadable reflection forms provide an excellent interactive study tool in adjunct with the text chapters. The image bank allows access to all book images and would be useful for teaching and presentation purposes. </p> <p>Overall this text would be an excellent resource to any practising physiotherapist or health professional within musculoskeletal and orthopaedics from the new graduate to the experienced clinician. It is concise, clear to follow and covers each subject extensively with evidence-based practise to accompany manual techniques. A must have for enhancing clinical practise."</p> <p><b>Tracy Ward, MCSP, BSc (HONS), MSc, Senior Physiotherapist and Clinical Pilates Specialist, BMI Healthcare Albyn Hospital, Aberdeen, Oct 14</b></p></p><h2>Non-Stop</h2><p>In the distant future of galactic empires, people of the Greene-tribe are shocked when they discover that they are not the center of a world of their own making</p><p>Brian W.

It is the human psyche.<br>&#x2015;<i>Positive Nihilism</i></p><p>Like many German intellectuals, Hartmut Lange has long grappled with Heidegger. <i>Positive Nihilism</i> is the result of a lifetime of reading Being and Time and offers a series of reflections that are aphoristic, poetic, and (appropriately, considering his object of study) difficult. Lange begins with an abyss (&#x201c;There is an abyss of the finite. It is temporality&#x201d;) and proceeds almost immediately to extremity: &#x201c;The twentieth century was governed by psychopaths. They collapsed the boundaries of moral reason and refuted Kant's analysis of consciousness.&#x201d; He reflects further: &#x201c;But who shall punish whom? One man's virtue is another man's crime. Thus Hitler could feel unwaveringly, as he wiped out entire populations, <i>the starry sky above him and the moral law within him</i>, as stipulated by Kant.&#x201d; He considers the concept of civilization (&#x201c;misleading&#x201d;; &#x201c;how should one oppose the remedies of civilization to the egomania, the murderous appetites of such outright psychopaths as Stalin or Pol Pot?&#x201d;), the act of thinking (a fata morgana), the psyche, and Heidegger's Dasein.</p><p><i>Positive Nihilism</i> can be considered a pocket companion to <i>Being and Time</i>. &#x201c;Heidegger's understanding of Being is nihilistic,&#x201d; Lange writes, and then explains his assertion. He draws on Kant, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Shakespeare's <i>Othello </i>for supporting arguments and illustrations. &#x201c;Everyone is possessed of the courage to have angst about death.

It's the story science fiction and Superman fans have been waiting for!</p></p><p><p>Everyone knows how Kal-El&#x2014;Superman&#x2014;was sent to Earth just before his planet exploded. But what led to such a disaster? Now, in <em>The Last Days of Krypton</em>, Kevin J. Anderson presents a sweeping tale of the pomp and grandeur, the intrigue and passion, and the politics and betrayals of a doomed world filled with brave heroes and cruel traitors.</p><p>Against the spectacular backdrop of Krypton's waning halcyon days, there is the courtship and marriage of Kal-El's parents, the brilliant scientist Jor-El and his historian wife, Lara. Together they fight to convince a stagnant, disbelieving society that their world is about to end. Jor-El's brother, Zor-El, leader of the fabled Argo City, joins the struggle not only to save the planet but also to fight against the menace of the ruthless and cunning General Zod.</p><p>The diabolical Zod, future archenemy of Superman, avails himself of a golden opportunity to seize power when the android Brainiac captures the capital city of Kandor. As Zod's grip on the populace tightens and his power grows, he too is blind to all the signs that point to the death of the very civilization he is trying to rule. </p><p>Through all of this, Jor-El and Lara's love for each other, their history, and their son allows for Krypton to live on even as the planet is torn apart around them. For in the escape of their baby lies Krypton's greatest gift&#x2014;and Earth's greatest hero.</p><p><em>The Last Days of Krypton</em> is a timeless, ground-breaking exploration of a world that has never been fully defined, and reveals the extraordinary origins of a legend that has never ceased to amaze and astound generation after generation.</p><p>Kevin J.

The CD-ROM contains 3 Java tutorial books in HTML, all major versions of the Java platform, and more. Softcover. DLC: Java (Computer program language).</p><p><p> Since the release of the Java Development Kit in May of 1995, the engineering team at Sun Microsystems has been hard at work improving and enhancing the Java platform. We have been similarly laboring to update The Java Tutorial to reflect the work of the engineers. </p><p> From the first page to the last, this edition now documents the APIs in the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.3. We have fully integrated SDK 1.3 updates into the text, plus we've added questions and exercises to help you practice what you learn. To help beginners avoid many common mistakes, an entire chapter is devoted to programming problems and their solutions. Convenient summaries at the end of each section are also new to this edition. </p><p> Like the first and second editions, this book is based on the online tutorial hosted at Sun Microsystem's Web site for the Java platform.Unlike the online version, this book solely focuses on the APIs needed by most beginning to intermediate programmers. Once you've mastered the material in this book, you can explore the rest of the Java platform on the Web site. </p><p> Our intent has always been to create a fun, easy-to-read, task-oriented programmer's guide with lots of practical examples to help people learn to program. Who Should Read This Book? </p><p> The book is geared towards both novice and experienced programmers.</p><p>New programmers can benefit most by reading the book from beginning to end, including the step by step instructions for compiling and running your first program in Getting Started (page 1). Programmers experienced with procedural languages such as C may wish start with the material on object-oriented concepts and features of the Java programming language. Experienced object programmers may want to jump feet first into more advanced trails, such as those on applets, essential classes, or user interfaces. </p><p> No matter what type of programmer you are, you can find a path through this book that fits your learning requirements. How to Use This Book </p><p> This book is designed so that you can either read it straight through or skip around from topic to topic. Whenever a topic is discussed in another place, you'll see a link to that place in the tutorial. Links are underlined and are followed by page numbers, like this: What Can Java Technology Do? (page 5). </p><p> All the sample code used in this book is available online and on the accompanying CD. The CD icon in the margin indicates that the code is available. At the end of each chapter there is also a "Code Sample" section with a table that specifies the locations of the examples on the CD and online. </p><p> We're dedicated to keeping this book up-to-date with the most current information.</p><p> <b> </b></p><p><b> Praise for <i>The Java&#x2122; Tutorial, Second Edition</i> </b></p><b> </b> <i> <p> "This book stands above the rest because it has been available on the web and read by thousands of Java programmers. The authors have received an enormous amount of feedback about which sections are good and which sections are confusing; the confusing ones have been improved. I doubt that any other Java book has undergone such trial by fire...." </p> </i> <p> -Metroplex Java User Group, www.javamug.org/reviews/ </p> <p> Whether you're taking a class or learning on the job, <b> <i>The Java&#x2122; Tutorial, Third Edition,</i> </b> is a hands-on guide that lets you quickly become proficient with the Java programming language. Written by members of the Java Software team at Sun Microsystems, the book uses an interactive approach to help you learn the Java platform by example. </p> <p> Since its first online release in 1995, the material in The Java&#x2122; Tutorial has been updated continuously to reflect reader feedback and new releases of the Java platform. This third edition has been thoroughly updated to cover v1.3 of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, as well as preceding versions as early as JDK 1.1. </p> You will find clear explanations of such fundamentals as objects, classes, and data structures. In addition, the book provides introductions to object-oriented programming, applet construction, and user interface design. Other topics include exceptions, I/O, and threads. To help beginners avoid many common mistakes, an entire chapter is devoted to programming problems and their solutions. Convenient summaries at the end of each section are new to this edition.

He has also served as managing editor for best-selling Bibles such as: The Love Languages Devotional Bible with Gary Chapman (Moody), Inspirational Bible with Max Lucado (Thomas Nelson), and the Case for Christ Study Bible with Lee Strobel (Zondervan). He is a graduate from Wheaton College (Wheaton, IL) and is an active teacher in his church for over twenty years. He is from Chicago, IL, where he resides with his wife and three children.There has long been a need for a Christian devotional that balances the literary virtues of readability, brevity, and depth. Christopher Hudson has threaded the theological needle with his latest work: 100 Names of God Daily Devotional (Rose Publishing). Beautiful in presentation, stylish in appearance, and formatted for readability, the book provides a refreshing reading experience often lacking in today s literature. More important, however, is its design and content. Hudson deftly identifies 100 common and not-so-common divine names that prove to be a devotional delight. Each devotional provides a Divine name/title/description, its English translation, and a biblical reference of its use. These are followed by engaging narratives that weave modern-day storylines with rich overviews of corresponding biblical passages that introduce the reader to that particular name of God, followed by its application to our lives. Each devotional concludes with a reflection question, commitment prayer, and suggested scripture for those wanting deeper study for personal enrichment. 100 Names of God Daily Devotional is accessible and approachable while also being relevant and readable. It meets the needs of growing believers who have the desire for a deeper dive in their daily devotions. Moreover, Christopher Hudson s ability to provide biblically-informed readers with a broad diversity of Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic divine names, each of which is indexed to Strong s numbering system, makes this devotional a theological treasure trove that will prove to be popular with pastors, professors, and mature Christian believers everywhere. --Freddy Cardoza, Ph.D. Chair, Department of Christian Education, Talbot School of Theology Executive Director, Society of Professors in Christian Education<br><br>When you know someone, you know their name. The person is important to you, and you to that person. It is a deeply intimate and personal experience to call a person by their name. And this is even more true in our relationship with God. 100 Names of God brings our connection to God to a new level of closeness and worship. You will find yourself finding God yet again. --John Townsend New York Times bestselling author Leadership expert, psychologist and theologian<br><br>This is a book I've been waiting for ever since I heard Amy Grant sing the song, El Shaddai some 30 years ago. For me it was a haunting song about the power of God s name. El Shaddai. El Elyon. Adonai. The lyrics by Michael Card beautifully tie the Old Testament promise into the New Testament fulfillment. By helping us understand the many names of God sprinkled through Scripture, this book does the same. As a result, the book is just as moving and memorable as the song. Read it in a long afternoon or over 100 days, and you ll be reminded (or learn) that God is a Strong Tower, a Rock, a Potter, a Consuming Fire, the One Who Lifts My Head, and, of course, our Deliverer. To complement the engaging, reader-friendly content, the book also includes a nice index and a plan for breaking the book down into a six-week personal or group study. This is a book I will not give away. It will stay on a nearby shelf in my office. --Jay Payleitner, best-selling author of What if God Wrote Your Bucket List?</p><h2>Core Concepts in Anatomy</h2><p>State University of New York at Stony Brook.

It has been laid out in an easy to read order, dividing the topics into four major sections: acoustics, instrumentation, anatomy and physiology of both the auditory and vestibular systems and psychoacoustics. Included as an Appendix is an overview of basic mathematics, which I found myself referring to often whilst reading this book! Each chapter contains a brief introduction, a clinical correlate in which the topic of the chapter is tied into a clinical scenario or pathology, and a succinct summary. <br><br> [Section 1: Basic Acoustics and Instrumentation,] has 8 chapters, all of which are quite equation heavy, but everything is explained as if for an undergraduate student so it is easy to follow.

Born in a region of Galicia then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Agnon settled in Palestine in 1924 after a decade in Germany. Blending antic humor, ironic detachment, erudition and yeasty lore, the tales include vivid autobiographical sketches of the author's ambivalent early life in Palestine ("Hill of Sand"); complex psychological portraits ("The Doctor's Divorce"); and poignant family drama ("Between Two Towns," which gently satirizes complacent, innocent German Jews of WWI, blissfully ignorant of their ultimate fate). Only a few of the selections are appearing in English for the first time, and nearly half have been previously anthologized. Still, by collecting some of Agnon's best, and by providing an insightful biographical sketch and extensive introductory notes, Mintz (Hebrew/ Brandeis) and Hoffmann (English/Fordham) go far in helping readers to appreciate why Agnon is widely considered the greatest modern writer of fiction in Hebrew. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Coeditors Mintz and Hoffman make their selection of stories by the first modern Hebrew writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize an argument for the author's peculiar greatness. They group their selections to reflect particular strains in Agnon's work. For instance, stories reflecting his abiding affection for the Eastern European village of his birth, which was swept away by the Holocaust, appear in the section "Buczacz: The Epic Life of One Town," the subtitle of which denotes Agnon's inkling that a single coherent community may be a model of all humans living together. Each section is separately introduced, and textual notes and a glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish terms are appended. If this editorial apparatus occasionally makes you feel wearisomely as if you were back in college, crabbedly struggling with a "text," let it go and just read the stories. They'll remind you of Borges and Joyce and the Bible, and they'll occasionally dazzle with their implicit conviction that "the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof." Our literary world is certainly fuller because of them. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Art of BMW: 85 Years of Motorcycling Excellence</h2><p><p>BMW began its life in aero-engineering--as anyone who&#x2019;s ever ridden one of its motorcycles might guess. These are bikes as close to airborne as any get. And what&#x2019;s more, fifty percent of all the motorcycles BMW has manufactured are still flying down the world&#x2019;s roads. These are the best, and in this book, the best of the best get their due, with brilliant, full-color photographs of BMW&#x2019;s classic models and detailed descriptions of their features, all located within the context of a concise history of this legendary marque. From the first of BMW&#x2019;s bikes, the R32, through the models that catapulted the company out of the ruins of World War II, to the latest bikes with the revamped opposed-twin-cylinder &#x201c;boxer&#x201d; engines that brought BMW its first fame--these are the bikes that made history, and, better yet, gave the most demanding riders a taste for flight. </p></p><p><p>Since Max Friz first mounted his innovative M2B32 opposed-twin engine in a motorcycle frame in 1923, the history of BMW motorcycles defines a constant and relentless quest for perfection. Over the next 85 years the company would create the most innovative and technologically advanced motorcycles produced anywhere on earth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But there&#x2019;s more to a BMW motorcycle than just innovation and technology. Even though the company earned a reputation for doing things differently than other companies, the company&#x2019;s motorcycles are not different just for the sake of being different. Each difference represents a brilliant and elegant solution to a real problem, leading BMW to be the first company to introduce many of the features that are later adopted by other manufactures. For example, BMW was the first motorcycle maker to offer anti-lock brakes. As beautiful as BMW motorcycles are in their totality, they may be even more beautiful when broken down to their details.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Art of BMW: Eighty-Five Years of Motorcycling Excellence</i> captures the elegant beauty of these amazing machines, both in their details and in the sum of their parts, through the masterful photography of Henry von Wartenberg and the brilliant writing of author Peter Gantriis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Art of BMW Motorcycles features the motorcycles of the Peter Nettesheim collection&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;s premier collections of BMW motorcycles. These wonderfully restored motorcycles exemplify the design and engineering prowess that define of the BMW motorcycle tradition.

The author of more than two hundred books, she is the winner of the Christopher Medal, the National Jewish Book Award, and a nominee for the National Book Award. Heidi Stemple is Jane Yolen&#39;s daughter and coauthor of five of her children&#39;s books.With more than 200 books to her name, popular storyteller Yolen (editor of Favorite Folktales Around the World) can be forgiven for one that doesn't quite measure up. The subtitle notwithstanding, this collection compiled with her grown daughter, with whom she has co-authored two children's books, is more apt to resonate with women than kids, for whom the authors' commentaries on parental expectations, sex and abuse, which are sprinkled with references to psychology and feminist texts, will be too didactic. Impatient teens who want to read a story only once may also balk at the structure. Each section highlights several variations of either a particular tale--including ones about Persephone, Rapunzel and Snow White--or a theme--such as caring daughters, mothers-in-law or bad seeds. On the other hand, mothers of all ages will welcome the opportunity to get reacquainted with mother-daughter folk stories like the French "Diamonds and Toads" (also known as "The Fairy") about just rewards, as well as ones from Bengal, Nigeria and Armenia that are less familiar in the West. Some stories are unnerving, like "Daughter, My Little Bread," an Indian tale about a newlywed who kills her mother and then is killed by her husband, while the Lebanese tale of self-sacrifice, "The Mother," is heart-warming in the best sense. There's no denying the pleasure of a well-told tale, or in this case forty of them, although mothers may need to do some extra work to spark conversation about them. Bibliography.

Penniless and illiterate, yet fiercely independent, Rose begins a two-year odyssey to revisit the land of her childhood, a land she once traveled with her father, an itinerant robe trader among the Assiniboines and Blackfeet. But the old ways of the hunter and trapper are disappearing. European investors are flooding the bison ranges with vast herds of cattle, raising mansions and polo fields on ground once claimed by teepees and sod-roofed hunters' shacks. With an aging roan gelding named Albert as her closest friend, Rose finds herself a reluctant hero in an ageless battle, the face of an indigenous population, both native and white, as she stubbornly pushes back against the invading aristocracy. And hanging over her every decision is an alcoholic father, who hunts bison inside the newly formed Yellowstone National Park, selling the mounted heads and tanned robes to Eastern tourists even as his daughter makes her stand against the destruction of the land she loves"--</p><p><p><b>Michael Zimmer</b>, an American history enthusiast from a very early age, has done extensive research on the Old West.

Zimmer lives in Utah with his wife, Vanessa, and two dogs.</p>*Starred Review* Rose Edwards takes up with two horse thieves after vigilantes kill her ne&#x2019;er-do-well husband, Muggy, and burn down her cabin. Rose owns the land, a pretty Montana homestead, but now she&#x2019;s penniless. The horse thieves are not quite as worthless as Muggy, and for them to invite her along is an act of kindness. What&#x2019;s more, Rose is strong and an expert shot with her big Sharps rifle. She rides with the rustlers, ensuring her place on a list kept by the mysterious Regulators. At last, weary of being pursued, Rose takes refuge in a whorehouse. She meets Nora Alder, and the two women pool their resources and their bitterness to begin a ranch on Nora&#x2019;s homestead. They might make a go of it but for the historic winter of 1886, which Zimmer describes in brutal, moving detail. With their herd wiped out, Rose and Nora are crowded by a corporate ranch wanting their water. The Regulators, hired by the corporation, attack the homestead in Rose&#x2019;s absence, leaving death and destruction in their wake and prompting Rose to become &#x201c;Rose of Yellowstone,&#x201d; giving over her life to revenge upon rapists, killers, and corporations. Rose is a beautiful composite of frontier women, some famous, some not; Zimmer&#x2019;s great strength is that he doesn&#x2019;t make his heroine anything other than an ordinary, decent woman who never had any luck. She falls so low, she has nothing to lose and can become a pure spirit, and an avenger of the weak. Think of Luke Short for action and Ernest Haycox for his sweeping style.

Schroth recounts the history of Jesuits in the United States. <strong>The American Jesuits</strong> isn&#x2019;t simply a book for Catholics; it&#x2019;s for anyone who loves a well-told historical tale. For more than 450 years, Jesuit priests have traveled the globe out of a religious commitment to serve others. Their order, the Society of Jesus, is the largest religious order of men in the Catholic Church, with more than 20,000 members around the world and almost 3,000 in the United States. It is one of the more liberal orders in the Church, taking very public stands in the U.S. on behalf of social justice causes such as the promotion of immigrants&#x2019; rights and humanitarian aid, including assistance to Africa&#x2019;s poor, and against American involvement in &#x201c;unjust wars.&#x201d; Jesuits have played an important part in Americanizing the Catholic Church and in preparing Catholic immigrants for inclusion into American society.</p><p>Starting off with the first Jesuit to reach the New World&#x2014;he was promptly murdered on the Florida coast&#x2014;Schroth focuses on the key periods of the Jesuit experience in the Americas, beginning with the era of European explorers, many of whom were accompanied by Jesuits and some of whom were Jesuits themselves. Suppressed around the time of the American Revolution, the Society experienced resurgence in the nineteenth century, arriving in the U.S. along with waves of Catholic immigrants and establishing a network of high schools and universities. In the mid-twentieth century, the Society transformed itself to serve an urbanizing nation.</p><p>Schroth is not blind to the Society&#x2019;s shortcomings and not all of his story reflects well on the Jesuits. However, as he reminds readers, Jesuits are not gods and they don&#x2019;t dwell in mountaintop monasteries. Rather, they are imperfect men who work in a messy world to &#x201c;find God in all things&#x201d; and to help their fellow men and women do the same.</p><p>A quintessential American tale of men willing to take risks &#x2014; for Indians, blacks, immigrants, and the poor, and to promote a loving picture of God&#x2014;<strong>The American Jesuits</strong> offers a broad and compelling look at the impact of this 400-year-old international order on American culture and the culture&#x2019;s impact on the Jesuits.</p></p><p><p><strong>Raymond A. Schroth, S.J.</strong>, is a Jesuit priest and a journalist. He is the author of six books, including <em>Dante to Dead Man Walking: One Reader's Journey through the Christian Classics</em>, and <em>American Journey of Eric Sevareid</em>. He has also written more than 300 articles and reviews on politics, religion, and the media, which have appeared in such publications as the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Boston Globe</em>, <em>Newsday</em>, and <em>America</em>, and he is an award-winning media critic for the <em>National Catholic Reporter</em>, for which he writes a regular column.</p><p>&#x201c;An enthralling celebration of the Jesuits&#x2019; presence in American Catholic life, masterfully testifying to the society&#x2019;s achievements. It should also serve as a much-needed blueprint for similar histories of other influential orders in American Catholic life. Fr. Schroth has set the standard.&#x201d;<br>-<i>National Catholic Reporter</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Schroth&#x2019;s lively, detailed, scrupulously honest narrative does not dispel the Jesuit mystique, but instead provides concrete examples from throughout the centuries that explain the society&#x2019;s origins and survival. . . . This is institutional history at its best. . . . Essential.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Choice</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Blending history and analysis, Schroth chronicles the society&#x2019;s weaknesses and failures, too, including its foot-dragging on racial issues. . . . Schroth also discusses the community&#x2019;s decline in numbers, but ends on a hopeful note. . . . This is an absorbing read for those with an interest in the Jesuits.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;An engaging read, and an elegant synthesis of four centuries of Jesuit heroics, controversies, flops, and hard work in the United States.

Williams is the best-selling author of many books about things kids love: dinosaurs, space travel, undersea adventures, strange aliens, and other subjects. His audio books are noted for their elaborate sound effects, original music, and performances by professional actors. All his books are thoroughly researched and filled with the latest, most accurate scienctific information.Ryan Pettersen "JPjunkie" (Minneapolis, MN) - In this book we're taken to a dinosaur filled park with a 7 year old boy name Timothy McDunn. This book is a short, but rich, adventure. The story is interesting and full of lots of dinosaur information that is perfect for young dinosaur lovers. The book keeps the mood light and not too scary for kids. Being a dinosaur enthusiast, and only 7 years old, when I read this book in 1988 I instantly fell in love with it. I still have the book and I still find it rather interesting to compare to Jurassic Park, though obviously too different types of stories. If you plan on buying this book, I highly recommend that you locate the fold-out map and the audio-tape that go along with it to maximize the enjoyment. The audio reading is excellent and a must have. The cast of voices and sound effects are done very well and gives a real feel of the atmosphere and mystery of being lost in a dinosaur park. --Amazon.com<br><br>CMV "Ms. Bassoonist" (Annapolis, MD) - I had this book and audio cassette when I was a kid -- I was in 2nd grade and COMPLETELY addicted to dinosaurs! The story was so exciting, and there was great music and sound effects on the recording. I loved it! --Amazon.com</p><h2>Reconstruction in Philosophy</h2><p>&#34;It was with this book that Dewey fully launched his campaign for experimental philosophy.&#34; - The New Republic</p><p>For those of us trying to make sense of the world and the institutions we devise to cope with it, John Dewey's <i>Reconstruction in Philosophy</i> offers tremendous insight. Writing a few years after World War I, the highly regarded American philosopher chose to embrace the modern sense of scientific optimism and apply it to the search for truth. He argued forcefully that our philosophical constructions are not based in reason, but only use higher thinking to justify themselves, and that we might find better ways of living if we examine our deepest beliefs and feelings with an eye toward their ultimate effects on us and others. This experimental philosophy, pragmatism, took several steps beyond the previous century's utilitarianism and was both hailed and reviled as a subsumption of philosophy and ethics into science.<p> Written as lectures, <i>Reconstruction in Philosophy</i> is marginally less dry than other philosophical tracts, but for readers new to the jargon, some sections can be slow-going. The pleasure of Dewey's works, though, comes from the intellectual stimulation of following a brilliant mind into then-uncharted epistemological territory. The last chapter, "Reconstruction As Affecting Social Philosophy," foreshadows so much 20th-century political thinking--from across the spectrum--that it ought to be required reading in high school civics classes. Did pragmatism change our lives for the better? The very fact that we can ask such a question is Dewey's legacy; the answer must remain an open question. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>The basic postulate of the text: namely, that the distinctive office, problems and subjectmatter of philosophy grow out of stresses and strains in the community life in which a given form of philosophy arises, and that its specific problems vary with the changes in human life that are always going on.</p><h2>POUPELLE OF CHIMNEY TOWN (JAPONAIS-FRAN�AIS) (Japanese Edition)</h2><p>Full color book by complete Division of kincon was stunned the world in black and white painted with one pen Nishino industry that defied common sense.

Day (Journey of Wolf, 1977) based the notebooks, which he portrays as written in Leavenworth prison in 1922, largely on Flores Magnon's letters, many written to an admirer who called herself Ellen White. And obviously the author has done his homework, as the book meticulously details much of the ebb and flow of the extraordinarily complicated struggle to overthrow Porfirio Diaz (1830-1915) and his successors, not neglecting its color and passion. But Day doesn't tell it chronologically, which may confuse readers seeking to grasp the essentials of the revolution through a fictionalized account. In an introduction, however, he makes it clear that the book is chiefly about its narrator and not about the events of history, although all the characters (except for an invented revolutionary woman whom Flores Magon loves) were actual people. The narrator, on which the book stands or falls, is an ironist who has seen too many hopes abandoned or betrayed, and as he writes, he distances himself somewhat from his earlier, enthusiastic self. Somehow, though, he doesn't ring true. A gringo intellectual is sensed behind this too self-conscious Mexican. Even the outsized figures of Villa and the Zapata brothers are diminished by being filtered through the consciousness of a man who seems to have settled for being ineffectual. What does come through unreduced is the sorry role the US played in this popular revolt, brutally fought by both sides. A vivid chapter in Mexican history but told by a less-than- vivid narrator. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Day ( Journey of the Wolf ) has discovered a fascinating protagonist for this novel of ideas--the eponymous Flores Magon, the anarchist journalist and failed lawyer (1873-1922) who became the voice and the conscience of the 1914 Mexican Revolution. Part biography and part polemic directed against the failed opportunities of the Revolution, the book takes the form of notebooks scribbled by Flores Magon in the Leavenworth (Kans.) penitentiary where he is imprisoned for having violated United States neutrality laws. Flashbacks cover Flores Magon's life from his birth in Oaxaca through the last days before his mysterious death in his cell. Through its pages pass the arrogant Pancho Villa, the reluctant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and the string of Mexican dictators against whom they fought. Joe Hill and Emma Goldman, who becomes Flores Magon's lover, also make brief appearances. Day adopts a lean, muscular style, but it takes a special writer to make this masculine prose work, and Day is neither a Malraux nor a Montherlant; ultimately, the hero's voice is not strong enough to propel the novel. The one altogether fictional character, the sultry lover of both Zapata and his brother, is treated rather badly, and an unpleasant strain of sexism runs through the work. The rich historical material here, however, exerts a pull on the reader's imagination. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>INTRO.TO CHEMISTRY &gt;CUSTOM&lt;</h2><p>Chem 110 book for West Virginia University.

Charles K. Armstrong contends that a major source of North Korea's strength and resiliency, as well as of its flaws and shortcomings, lies in the poorly understood origins of its system of government. He examines the genesis of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) both as an important yet rarely studied example of a communist state and as part of modern Korean history. </p><p>North Korea is one of the last redoubts of "unreformed" Marxism-Leninism in the world. Yet it is not a Soviet satellite in the East European manner, nor is its government the result of a local revolution, as in Cuba and Vietnam. Instead, the DPRK represents a unique "indigenization" of Soviet Stalinism, Armstrong finds. The system that formed under the umbrella of the Soviet occupation quickly developed into a nationalist regime as programs initiated from above merged with distinctive local conditions.</p><p>Armstrong's account is based on long-classified documents captured by U.S. forces during the Korean War. This enormous archive of over 1.6 million pages provides unprecedented insight into the making of the Pyongyang regime and fuels the author's argument that the North Korean state is likely to remain viable for some years to come.</p></p><p><p>Charles K. Armstrong is the Korea Foundation Associate Professor of Korean Studies at Columbia University. He is the editor of <i>Korean Society: Civil Society, Democracy, and the State</i> and coeditor of<i> Korea at the Center: Dynamics of Regionalism in Northeast Asia</i>.</p><p>"Armstrong has carefully gone over all of the newly available documents on the founding of the North Korean regime to ask why Pyongyang, in spite of the appalling suffering of its people, remains one of the last holdouts of 'unreformed' Marxism-Leninism."</p> (<i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br><p>"Charles K. Armstrong's <i>The North Korean Revolution, 1945&#x2013;1950</i> is a pioneering work.... This eye-catching book offers a wealth of factual information on the genesis of the North Korean state. It introduces a unique comprehensive perspective for the analysis of postcolonial Korean modernization, communist state formation, and creation of new imagined national and social identities and communities in the North. It is a new classic in Korean studies and a must-read for all aspiring students of Korean history and Korean affairs."</p> (Alexandre Y. Mansourov <i>Journal of Asian Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"Charles K. Armstrong takes advantage of new archival materials to rethink the history and character of North Korea. In considering the critical years of North Korea's development prior to the outbreak of the Korean War, Armstrong's <i>The North Korean Revolution, 1945&#x2013;1950</i>, delivers some surprising, heterodox conclusions."</p> (John Feffer <i>Korean Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>"This book provides a wealth of factual information and historical background that increases the reader's understanding of North Korea's communist history and present idiosyncrasies."</p> (Jeffrey J. Kuebler <i>Military Review</i>)<br><br><p>"In a world where the kind of Marxist-inspired, state-directed development embodied by Soviet Russia has long since been discredited as ineffective, the North Korean economy and state management continue to resist the forces of the North Korean people. Armstrong wants to explain this rather counterintuitive longevity of a state whose like can be found nowhere else in the world except in Cuba.... This work will be indispensable for anyone hoping to understand the postwar history of Korea and East Asia."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)</p><h2>Cultural Action for Freedom (HER Reprint Series)</h2><p>In this volume, we have chosen to highlight the importance of education to human rights by reprinting two articles written by Paulo Freire (1921-1997) in 1970 for the <i>Harvard Educational Review</i>.

He made us aware of our mindless cruelties, and now the challenge to all of us is to do something about those cruelties."

Why do we tend to hurt those we care for most? How do families find themselves broken? The reason is often the way we think. Beyond behaviors and deeper than attitudes, thinking determines outcome more than anything else. The Book of Romans challenges us to be no longer conformed to the patterns of the world but rather to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. So much of what we are missing in life is associated with the way we process events in the world around us, draw conclusions about our circumstances, and act out of conclusions uninformed by the truth of Jesus and the gospel. In a world constantly bombarded by the fictions of a self-absorbed culture, managing our thinking becomes an even trickier proposition.<br><br> If you repeatedly find yourself in places where you don&#x2019;t want to go, it&#x2019;s your thinking that&#x2019;s leading you there.

That&#x2019;s how Toby Rinaldi, son of a U.N. Ambassador, wound up kidnapped on his way to a California amusement park, and how Robby Burnes, orphaned son of British nobility, wound up snatched on the snowy streets of New York City. But as Robby&#x2019;s famous namesake taught us, the best laid plans don&#x2019;t always work out as intended. Especially not when you&#x2019;re a kidnapper in the hands of Gregory Mcdonald.<br><br>The comic genius behind the Fletch and Flynn books, Gregory Mcdonald also penned the two brilliant kidnapping novels appearing here for the first time in three decades &#x2013; and the first time ever in a single volume. Two precocious eight-year-old boys...two teams of kidnappers, in way over their heads...two opportunities for mayhem, danger, and the trenchant social satire no crime writer has ever delivered like Mcdonald.</p><p>Gregory Mcdonald (February 15, 1937 - September 7, 2008) was an American mystery writer best known for his creation of the character Irwin Maurice Fletcher, an investigative reporter who preferred the nickname "Fletch."<br><br>Two of the Fletch books earned Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America: Fletch was named Best First Novel in 1975, and Confess, Fletch won for Best Paperback Original in 1977. This is the only time a novel and its sequel won back-to-back Edgars. Mcdonald would go on to write seven more Fletch novels, including the prequels Fletch Won and Fletch Too. The original book became a 1985 movie of the same name starring Chevy Chase.<i>Kidnappings link two exceptional crime novels,&nbsp;<i>Snatched</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Safekeeping,</i>&nbsp;by Mcdonald (1937&#x2013;2008), best known for his Fletch and Flynn series...Both novels showcase Mcdonald&#x2019;s wit, but it&#x2019;s the latter that really shows his versatility. Mcdonald gleefully mixes Dickensian characters and Charles Lederer&#x2013;style dialogue ...This compendium volume will please fans and casual readers alike who want to see the range that Mcdonald was capable of beyond his most famous creations.&nbsp;<br><i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</i><br><br>This twin-pack proves that Mcdonald successfully devoted his creative and satiric energies to stories other than those featuring Fletch or Flynn. So along with the undeniable entertainment they provide, the two novels resurrected in SNATCH might cause fans of Fletch/Flynn to search deeper into Mcdonald&#x2019;s backlist of published works.&nbsp;&#x2014;Bookgasm<br></i><br><i>Hard Case Crime is&nbsp;at it again, and here the publisher combines two books by Gregory Mcdonald that were last published over 30 years ago.

His first exhibition sold out, as did the second and he has since become Scotland&#39;s most successful contemporary artist. Vettriano&#39;s images are neo-realist - real in the sense that he portrays recognizable people in believable situations, yet heightened to that level of dramatic or romantic intensity which fueled the fiction of the Hollywood dream factory or the novels of Raymond Chandler or F. Scott Fitzgerald. They are tales without text, storyboards about love and lust, possession and longing, pursuit and conquest. He seems to understand perfectly the stylish sexiness and intrigue that occurs when high life and low life collide. His men are predators, gamblers - hard-edged but possibly soft-centred, Bogartian in period and attitude. His women are vulnerable, pliable, probably playthings if the price is right. And beyond the implied narrative of his paintings there is a curious remembrance of times past and lost, of squandered youth on blissful beaches. Critics have linked Vettriano with the bleak paintings of Hopper, the sleazy photographs of Brassai, yet he is unique, identifiable at fifty yards. Anthony Quinn has written an elegant biographical portrait of the man from childhood to present, encompassing his family, schooling, and career as well as pausing at significant moments in his career.</p><p></p><h2>Horse Sense (Saddle Club(R))</h2><p>Lisa love being a member of the Saddle Club.

In this astonishingly rich biography, Rhys Isaac mines this remarkable document--and many other sources--to reconstruct Carter's interior world as it plunged into revolution. <br> The aging patriarch, though a fierce supporter of American liberty, was deeply troubled by the rebellion and its threat to established order. His diary, originally a record of plantation business, began to fill with angry stories of revolt in his own little kingdom. Carter writes at white heat, his words sputtering from his pen as he documents the terrible rupture that the Revolution meant to him. Indeed, Carter felt in his heart he was chronicling a world in decline, the passing of the order that his revered father had bequeathed to him. Not only had Landon's king betrayed his subjects, but Landon's own household betrayed him: his son showed insolent defiance, his daughter Judith eloped with a forbidden suitor, all of his slaves conspired constantly, and eight of them made an armed exodus to freedom. The seismic upheaval he helped to start had crumbled the foundations of Carter's own home. <br> Like Laurel Ulrich in her classic <em>A Midwife's Tale</em>, Rhys Isaac here unfolds not just the life, but the mental world of our countrymen in a long-distant time. Moreover, in this presentation of Landon Carter's passionate narratives, the diarist becomes an arresting new character in the world's literature, a figure of Shakespearean proportions, the Lear of his own tragic kingdom. This long-awaited work will be seen both as a major contribution to Revolution history and a triumph of the art of biography.</p><p><br><strong>Rhys Isaac</strong> is Distinguished Visiting Professor at the College of William and Mary and a Research Associate of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for <em>The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790</em>. An Emeritus Professor at La Trobe University, he lives in Melbourne, Australia.<br>In the tiny world of colonial Virginia, Landon Carter was a very big cheese. He was the patriarch of one of Virginia's oldest, wealthiest and most prominent families -- First Families of Virginia through and through, right up there with the Byrds, the Berkeleys, the Fitzhughs, the Lees and the Lightfoots -- and the owner of an immense estate. Not merely did he preside over the plantation called Sabine Hall, about 50 miles north of Williamsburg, with its "total enslaved population of around 100," but he "also owned more distant plantations . . . in further parts of Richmond County, in Northumberland County down-river, in Fauquier, Stafford and Prince William, and Loudoun Counties up-river, and in York, and King and Queen Counties to the southward," a thralldom in which some 400 additional slaves labored.<p>By the standards of his time, place and class, Carter probably was a good man. He was a son of the Enlightenment who read extensively and was intimate with the classics. Something of an amateur physician, he tended assiduously to the medical needs of all those who came under his sway. He married three times -- all three wives died -- and was the father of seven children. As a young man he "began the typical career of a high-born Virginia gentleman," serving as "a justice of the peace in the county court, a colonel of the county militia, and a parish vestryman of the tax-supported Church of England, and he continued in these offices until revolution disrupted the whole system." Like many other colonial grandees, he was devoutly loyal to the crown and maintained stout allegiance to it right up to enactment of the Stamp Act in 1765. Thereafter he was a strong (if somewhat befuddled) supporter of the revolution and the new order it brought, though at his death in December 1778 its full implications remained unknown.</p><p>He was also a devoted, if not outright obsessive, diarist, from 1758 until his death. "Landon Carter's long-kept record is truly remarkable among diaries," Rhys Isaac writes. "The imprint of its angry keeper is so intense, and his outrage resonates with the deep family drama embedded in one of the most momentous revolutions in the history of the world. Through all his experiences he gives us an unequaled view of a man, like many of his contemporaries, divided within himself. He clung to his British constitutional heritage, but his heart was given to the cause of American liberty."</p><p>Isaac, visiting professor at the College of William and Mary and author of The Transformation of Virginia, 1740-1790, uses Carter's diaries as the foundation upon which to build Landon Carter's Uneasy Kingdom. He quotes from them extensively within his own narrative (he identifies them by setting them in italics) toward achieving his two-fold purpose: "to open for readers an understanding of Landon Carter's world as he knew it" and "to show the Revolution as personal experience." Like so many others who have inhabited American academia since the late 1960s, Isaac is under the spell of the race-gender-class mantra and thus is susceptible to interpreting the past through the lens of the present, but the reader who is willing to overlook his occasional attitudinizing will find that in collaboration with Landon Carter he has created a detailed, persuasive picture of a world so different from our own as to be almost unimaginable.</p><p>Isaac's biases show most clearly in his emphasis on that buzzword of radical feminism, "patriarchy." Right at the outset he posits Carter's "self-idealization as lord and patriarch," and he beats that drum incessantly thereafter. In this instance, though, he is on firm ground. Colonial America was a patriarchy, just as was the England it took as model, and it was nowhere more so than in the South, where patriarchal sway extended beyond the boundaries of natural family to those wholly involuntary members of the extended family, the slaves:</p><p>"Landon, according to his worldview, knew that he had a patriarchal duty to all on his estate. Care &amp; protection was what the feudal lord owed his dependent inferiors. In return, of course, they owed him service, deference, and obedience. This was very much how Landon saw his relationship to his enslaved workers. It was congruent with his own sacred obligation to his own sometimes-harsh, sometimes-benign master, God. . . . Landon knew that he had divine authority to keep idlers at their tasks. He knew he had a duty to punish as necessary the sinful children of Eve who were in his charge."</p><p>The sinful included not just his slaves, but his own children. His eldest son, Robert Wormsley Carter, lived at Sabine Hall with his wife, Winifred, whom it is no exaggeration to say Landon Carter loathed -- in the diaries she is portrayed as "the outspoken contrary woman," and Carter records "the sad, the infuriating and the humiliating intimacies" of her life -- and treated accordingly. His daughter Judith married over his vehement opposition and was repudiated for a long time before an eventual reconciliation. Carter entered all his complaints in his diary, then left it where family members could read its "passionate narratives" and, presumably, bathe in their own guilt. "These dramas are conflicts such as every family harbors to this day," Isaac writes; "but they are also historic since they carry reverberations of the disturbed times through which the diarist felt himself fated to live."</p><p>It is difficult for us now to comprehend just how disturbed those times actually were. Well before the Revolution began, the known world was undergoing deep change. Carter was well acquainted with a new kind of novel -- Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Pamela -- that "told strong stories of [women's] self-realization and so contributed subtly but surely to the subversion of the ancient hierarchical order of ruling fathers." Carter, Isaac argues, was torn between "sentimental" and "authoritarian" stories: "he wanted to be a lordly patriarch like his father; and he wanted to be loved and understood like Pamela or Clarissa."</p><p>Carter's world was falling apart, and Isaac makes a rather strong case that he knew it. As Isaac writes (in the clotted prose that can make reading this book a mighty labor), "In the political sphere, expectations of government shifted away from kingly patriarchalism toward the more comprehensively participatory modes that would generate the ideology of democracy." Carter's diaries in his final years "come from a late moment of an ancient regime of knowledge and society. The diarist felt in his heart that he was chronicling decline. His own death could not be far off, and he sensed also the passing of the world which his altogether admirable father had bequeathed to him."</p><p>Nothing hastened the end of that world so emphatically and conclusively as the American Revolution. After the Stamp Act, Carter knew, as Benjamin Franklin did, that he could not be a free man under British rule, and he turned from royalist to revolutionary, just as Franklin did. "It is very hard now . . . to realize the radicalism of this step," Isaac writes, "and so to understand not only the agony that Landon felt, deep-dyed patriarchal monarchist that he was, but also the kind of collective anguish of the colonists, long so proudly British." The reader might wish for more graceful prose, but Isaac is right when he says: "Casting out the king and founding the republic was a patricidal act; and the father killing was cosmic. It profoundly changed the order of the world. The principle of patriarchy within the institution of monarchy had been comprehensive; it had given coherence to the whole system."</p><p>That a better system replaced it is self-evident, but this made it no easier for those who had to undergo the metamorphosis. The autumn of these patriarchs was wrenching and painful. It is perhaps easier to pass judgment on them than to understand them, but Isaac manages to accomplish the latter even as he indulges himself in the former. </p><p>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

This appreciation has been enshrined in many religios and moral codes throughout the world, but has been recently lost in the West. The author reviews the near-death experience, moral codes and argues for a new ethic based on the fact of &#34;empathetic resonance&#34; between people. David Lorimer is the author of &#34;Survival?

Ethiopians believe that this chapel contains the Ark of the Covenant; their religious epic &#34;The Glory of Kings&#34; gives an account of how Makeda, the Queen of Sheba had a son by Solomon and how it was this son who removed the Ark from Jerusalem because of the disobedience of the people of Israel. Stuart Munro-Hay began excavating at Aksum in 1974, but his work was interrupted by the revolution. He did, however, make many valuable friendships in the city and learnt to speak the language of the guards, a combination that has led him to become recognised as the premier Aksumite historian. Together with Roderick Grierson, a semiotic philologist, he investigated the ancient mystery to try and determine what the Ark was, if it could have been carried to Ethiopia, and, if it was not at Aksum, what is being guarded in the chapel.</p><p>Stuart Munro-Hay has recently been appointed Visiting Professor at the University of Berlin; and Roderick Grierson is a Fellow at the W.E.B.

The melodies are restored to their original form, as are the texts, as called for by the Second Vatican Council. (If one is singing a well-known hymn such as Conditor alme siderum or Veni, Creator Spiritus in Latin or English, it would be best to use the melodic version of the Liber Hymnarius.) Especially important is the revised four-line notation of this book and the explanation of it (in Latin) in the foreword. The revised notation conveys much of the subtlety of the early neumes, and it makes clear that chant should be sung with the flexibility of speech-based rhythm rather than with equal rhythmic values. This revised notation will no doubt be employed when the reformed Roman antiphonale and the revised Graduale Romanum finally appear.</p><p></p><h2>Shed Decor: How to Decorate and Furnish Your Favorite Garden Room</h2><p>In need of a place to work, play, or relax?

Great battle history of the sea.</p><p></p><h2>The Crystal Cave</h2><p>Fifth century Britain is a country in chaos and division after the Roman withdrawal. This is Merlin&#39;s world - the illegitimate son of a South Wales princess - he is aware of the gift of &#34;the sight&#34;. The other books in this trilogy include &#34;The Hollow Hills&#34; and &#34;The Last Enchantment&#34;.</p><p>Initially published nearly thirty years ago, Mary Stewart's <i>The Crystal Cave</i> has been spellbinding readers and converting them into serious Arthurian buffs ever since. The first in a series of four books, this novel focuses on the early life of Merlin the magician, and the political developments of fifth-century Britain. Not for the fainthearted, this verbose text pays careful attention to historical details and methodical plot development.<p> Merlin's childhood is formed by the absence of his reticent, convent-bound mother and his unnamed and unknown father. As the bastard grandson of a local king, Merlin is the object of both envy and ridicule. His strange powers and predictions earn him greater status as a pariah, and he leaves home as a preadolescent. Returning years later as a young man--empowered by self-knowledge and magic--Merlin finds himself caught in the currents of the shifting kingdoms.</p><p> As an established classic in this genre, and the first in a popular series, <i>The Crystal Cave</i> introduces this familiar character with fresh sensitivity. While readers looking for the romance of <i>First Knight</i> will be disappointed, those happy with tight writing and a complex story line will be satisfied. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>If you haven&#39;t read Mary Stewart&#39;s Arthurian Saga, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

Narrated by Zinn, this version opens with the events of 9/11 and then jumps back to explore the cycles of U.S. expansionism from Wounded Knee to Iraq, stopping along the way at World War I, Central America, Vietnam, and the Iranian revolution.

Gourmet Meals in Minutes will show you how to create a wide variety of mouth-watering, nutritious meals without spending all day in the kitchen.</p><p>Having trained thousands of professional chefs, the CIA addresses home cooks here in an effort to "cultivate a passion for cooking" despite today's hectic pace. With an emphasis on a multiplicity of ethnic flavors, the recipes are largely familiar and manageable. In fact, many of the simpler ones (Vichyssoise, Romaine and Grapefruit Salad with Walnuts and Stilton; Ratatouille; and Tiramisu) may be found in scores of other cookbooks. However, such dishes as Lobster and Roasted Red Pepper Salad, and Pesto-Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Tomato Relish seem rather ambitious when described as "meals in minutes." And suggesting the use of premade phyllo dough as a prime ingredient in Fennel and Chorizo Strudels, or packaged puff pastry dough in Fresh Fruit Galette, undercuts the book's premise. Oddly for home cooking, nearly every recipe serves eight. Still, there are dozens of quick and easy recipes, such as Ni�oise-Style Grilled Tuna and Cider-Braised Pork Medallions. Presentation is often a key aspect, as in Haricots Verts with Prosciutto and Gruy�re, in which prosciutto slices are twisted into spirals to resemble roses.

We are carried through his introduction to the range where he becomes an expert cowboy and marksman. After winning a shooting contest in Deadwood, South Dakota in 1876, his skills as a marksman earned him the nickname Deadwood Dick . In all, Nat Love spent twenty years living the life of a cowboy. In his latter life, Nat Love and several of his former saddle mates worked for the railroad. He became a devoted father and family man.</p><p>Thousands of black cowpunchers drove cattle up the Chisholm Trail after the Civil War, but only Nat Love wrote about his experiences. Born to slaves in Davidson County, Tennessee, the newly freed Love struck out for Kansas after the war. He was fifteen and already endowed with a reckless and romantic readiness. In wide-open Dodge City he joined up with an outfit from the Texas Panhandle to begin a career riding the range and fighting Indians, outlaws, and the elements. Years later he would say, &#34;I had an unusually adventurous life&#34;. That was rare understatement. More characteristic was Love&#39;s claim: &#34;I carry the marks of fourteen bullet wounds on different parts of my body, most any one of which would be sufficient to kill an ordinary man, but I am not even crippled&#34;. In 1876 a virtuoso rodeo performance in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, won him the moniker of Deadwood Dick. He became known as DD all over the West, entering into dime novels as a mysteriously dark and heroic presence. This vivid autobiography includes encounters with Bat Masterson and Billy the Kid, a soon-after view of the Custer battlefield, and a successful courtship. Love left the range in 1890, the year of the official closing of the frontier. Then, as a Pullman train conductor he traveled his old trails, and those good times bring his story to a satisfying end.Introducing this Bison Books edition is Brackette F.

Bert Cohen of the Dental Unit of the Sixth South African Armored Division, Nineteenth Field Ambulance, made the following entry in his war diary:<br><br>After lunch Hilton Barber lent me his jeep and I scudded away on a delightful jaunt. We traveled through twisting country byways until the town of Monza. There we followed route 36 northward to Lecco. As we bypassed the town we got our first view of the famous Alpine lakes . . . an azure strip of unbelievable blue flanked by great mountains. . . . We passed through several icy tunnels and the beauty of the scene grew more breathtaking as we neared Bellagio, a wonderful village nestling in the fork of the lake beneath the majestic mountains. . . . A drove of little boys clambered onto the jeep, an incredible number appeared from all over the place. At one stage Wilson counted 21 of them on the jeep. Bellagio was indeed delightful. It was while there that we heard that the war was over, a report that was subsequently verified as we drove on down Lake Como to Como. . . . All along the road from Bellagio throngs had lined each village street and flowers in profusion had been tossed into the jeep.<br><br>So, in Bellagio, right here, feted by children and flowers, my uncle&#x2019;s war ended. &#x201c;GUERRA FINITA!!!&#x201d;&#x2014;�&#x201c;WAR OVER!!!&#x201d;&#x2014;�he exulted in his diary. He was twenty-�six and far from home. As a young dentistry graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand, he had enlisted in Johannesburg on January 15, 1943. After training, he flew by stages to Egypt to join the Allies&#x2019; North African campaign. From there, in April 1944, he embarked for Italy, on the lowest deck, landing in Taranto, near the heel of Italy&#x2019;s boot. Churchill had called Italy &#x201c;the soft underbelly of the Axis,&#x201d; but resistance to the Allied assault was stern. Bert&#x2019;s progress northward through Naples, Rome, and Florence to Bellagio was no sunlit Italian passeggiata. The winter of 1944 was spent encamped high in the freezing Apennines facing a German line stretching across the country from Pisa to Rimini. He filled teeth in freezing, improvised dental surgeries.<br><br>Bert had to battle through the German lines. At Finale Emilia, north of Modena, on April 24, 1945, he was ordered into a bend in the Penaro River where a Nazi column was trapped. Skiet gemors&#x2014;�Shoot the garbage&#x2014;�was a rough guide to his Afrikaner com�mander&#x2019;s battle code. An artillery battery pulverized the enclave. Wrecked vehicles smoldered. Wounded horses, nostrils flared in gasping horror, bayed&#x2014;�a terrible sound. In the carnage, ammunition exploded and tires burst. The stench of roasted flesh and putrefaction pervaded the air. Intestines of gutted animals ballooned from their carcasses. A squad of South African infantry marched through the ruins, bringing a bullet of mercy to animals that still agonized. One dead German in particular caught Bert&#x2019;s eye: a blond, square-�jawed young man with a long straight nose, hair flecked with blood and smoke, legs twisted grotesquely, abdomen ripped open, coils of gut spilling through a ragged gash into the dust, sightless blue eyes gazing at infinity. Beside the corpse lay scattered letters from the soldier&#x2019;s mother in Hamburg. She wrote about Der Angriff, the Allied bombardment of the city that killed more than 42,000 people. Uncertain what to do, Bert returned the letters to the dead man&#x2019;s pocket before grabbing a few ampoules of morphine found in an abandoned, ammunition-�filled German ambulance.<br><br>That single German corpse among the more than 600,000 casualties of the Italian campaign haunted my uncle for the rest of his life. Bert dwelt on him as if this death were his responsibility, or as if he, a Jew from South Africa, might somehow have brought this handsome young man, Hitler&#x2019;s model Aryan, back to the life denied him. The dead man inhabited his dreams. Bert thought that he should have kept the letters, for some reason, perhaps to return them to a bereaved mother in Hamburg. He was a link in a circle that never closed.<br><br>Bellagio also marked him. He returned four days after his first visit, on May 11, 1945, and was billeted for a week in the magnificent Villa Gerly, on the banks of the lake. His diary records a lunch that day at Silvio&#x2019;s restaurant. &#x201c;We lunched sumptuously on fresh trout and fresh butter,&#x201d; Bert wrote. &#x201c;Such food was so novel and so exciting to our palates long jaded by M and V that I for one ate far too much.&#x201d; Canned meat and vegetables (M and V), tasting of neither, were the staple military diet. After lunch Bert dozed off on the grass, a siesta troubled only by ants. In the late afternoon he decided to go for a swim:<br><br>We rowed out into the middle of the lake and there I plunged in. The water was icy cold a few feet below the surface. About halfway I realized I had overestimated my swimming ability and underestimated the distance. The swim turned into a horrifying ordeal. I was fighting panic, not with complete success. It is one thing to be able to take a grip if you can stop and weigh up the situation but quite another if you can&#x2019;t stop to collect your calm. I couldn&#x2019;t stop. It would have been better to have doggy paddled and relaxed but driving panic made my haste frantic. I was exhausted when I reached the shore. My heart was pounding and my head was bursting with pain. It was quite the most unnerving and terrifying experience I have had since I left home.<br><br>In this way, four days after the end of the war, Captain Cohen almost lost his life in Bellagio. He would have gone out in a sumptuous manner, after a lunch of delicious fish, in the midst of a beautiful lake, beneath the mountains, a few hundred yards from the Punto Spartivento. It is a good thing, however, that he did not encounter a watery North Italian grave. What a waste, people would have said, to die when the war was over. As if the war being over made any difference to the waste and the grief. The thing about life&#x2019;s chains, and the lines of memory that eddy along them, is you never know when they may get broken&#x2014;�in a mountainous trench, on a bend in the river, or three hundred meters down in a sunlit lake after a good lunch celebrating peace.<br><br>Excerpted from The Girl from Human Street by Roger Cohen.

We don&#x2019;t waste electricity.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Nancy said again. &#x201c;What can I do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Get dressed so I can check the damage,&#x201d; said Victoria, who, at ninety-two, was one-third the age of her ancient house and not quite twice the age of its electrical wiring. She looked at her watch. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost five. I&#x2019;ll try to get the electrician before he leaves.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>LeRoy Watts was finishing up his paperwork in his shop on Circuit Avenue in Oak Bluffs when the phone rang. Maureen, his office manager, had left for the day.<br>&#x201c;Watts Electrical Supply. How can I help you?&#x201d;<br>Victoria explained what had happened.<br>&#x201c;Sure, I know that outlet under the window,&#x201d; said LeRoy, tapping his pen on the side of his coffee mug. &#x201c;You and I talked about replacing that old wiring.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The outlet is partially melted, there&#x2019;s a foot-long plume of smoke on the wall above it, and the fuse blew.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got circuit breakers, Mrs. Trumbull. Jerry Sparks replaced your fuse box last fall.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Circuit breaker, then,&#x201d; said Victoria. &#x201c;Would you please ask him to repair my guest&#x2019;s damage? I fail to understand why people use hair dryers on the Vineyard.&#x201d;<br>LeRoy paused. &#x201c;I had to let Jerry Sparks go.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shame. He did excellent work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. But he had personal problems. I&#x2019;ll try to get to your place myself. Let&#x2019;s see.&#x201d; He shuffled through the papers on his desk and found the calendar that Maureen kept. &#x201c;Best I can do is four days from now. Monday. That work for you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; said Victoria.<br>&nbsp;<br>Victoria disconnected and, still feeling exasperated with Nancy and her hair dryer, went into the bathroom to see what damage her guest had done in there. She was about to turn on the light to look when the phone rang. She hustled to answer before the machine picked up. It was her granddaughter, Elizabeth.<br>&#x201c;Hi, Gram. I&#x2019;m calling from work. I need to pick up some stuff at the boatyard, and wondered if you&#x2019;d like to come along for the ride?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. That would be lovely.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in fifteen minutes.&#x201d;<br>Victoria went back upstairs and told Nancy to move her belongings into the West Room, which was on a different electrical circuit. Nancy continued to apologize and assured Victoria she would never, never again use a hair dryer in her house.<br>Once Victoria had settled Nancy into the room across the hall, she went downstairs again to wait for her granddaughter. She slung her blue coat over her shoulders and stood at the top of the stone steps with her worn leather bag and the lilac-wood walking stick Elizabeth had carved for her. Victoria felt no need for the walking stick, but she didn&#x2019;t want to hurt Elizabeth&#x2019;s feelings by not using it.<br>It was a mild May day, with the scent of lilacs in the air. The top was down on Elizabeth&#x2019;s convertible. Victoria got into the passenger seat, feeling quite sporty. On the way to Vineyard Haven, she lifted her great nose to breathe in the sweet smell of spring, different at each turn in the road. New-mown grass, lilacs, winter-wet leaves pushed aside by green shoots. They crossed the bridge over Mill Brook and she caught the scent of ferns and skunk cabbage.<br>&#x201c;We bought new lines for the harbor launch at the boatyard&#x2019;s marine store,&#x201d; explained Elizabeth, who worked as dockmaster in the Oak Bluffs harbor. &#x201c;They spliced eye loops in the lines so we can simply drop a line over a piling without having to tie it each time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Splicing takes a bit of skill,&#x201d; said Victoria, who understood boats. &#x201c;Who does the work?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Emily Cameron. She runs the computer at the boatyard store and splices most of the lines.&#x201d;<br>At the boatyard, they parked next to a black-hulled sailboat that was high up above them on a cradle. Inside the store, Elizabeth checked out the new lines while Victoria went around the partition that made a kind of office for Emily Cameron. Emily, a painfully shy young woman, could use a boost in her self-esteem.<br>&#x201c;I wanted to tell you how impressed I am that you do the boat-yard&#x2019;s splicing, Emily.&#x201d;<br>Emily blushed at the compliment. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing much.&#x201d; She turned back to her computer. She was a thickset girl with glasses and dark hair tied back in a ponytail. Long bangs touched the top of her glasses frame.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re working late, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s that time of year, Mrs. Trumbull.&#x201d; Emily looked up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re open until seven every night, getting ready for the season.&#x201d;<br>She smiled, and when Emily smiled, she could be almost attractive, Victoria thought. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your mother? We missed her at church Sunday.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Much better, thanks. She&#x2019;s back at work. It was just a nasty cold.&#x201d;<br>Victoria was sympathetic. &#x201c;Spring colds can be miserable. How&#x2019;s the job going?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Great. I love working here. Computers, boats.&#x201d; Emily lifted her hands, palms up, as if to say that&#x2019;s all anyone needed. She turned her chair away from the computer to face Victoria. &#x201c;And, Mrs. Trumbull, I&#x2019;ve got a boyfriend!&#x201d; She blushed again.<br>&#x201c;Wonderful. Who&#x2019;s the lucky man?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jerry Sparks. He works at Watts Electrical Supply.&#x201d;<br>Victoria decided not to mention that she&#x2019;d spoken to LeRoy Watts less than an hour before and he&#x2019;d told her he&#x2019;d fired Jerry Sparks. &#x201c;Jerry did some work for me several months ago. He seems like a nice boy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s wonderful, Mrs. Trumbull. We&#x2019;re celebrating our anniversary tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Anniversary?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been seeing each other for three weeks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Victoria.<br>At that point, Elizabeth came around the partition, her arms laden with lengths of nylon line. &#x201c;Nice job with the eye splices, Emily.&#x201d; She held up one of the loops in the soft line.<br>Emily pushed her glasses back into place. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll print out the paperwork for the harbormaster.&#x201d;<br>Paperwork in hand, Victoria and Elizabeth left the boatyard and drove to the harbor, where Elizabeth dropped off the lines, and they headed for home.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kind of quiet, Gram. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br>Victoria settled her coat under her before she answered. &#x201c;Emily tells me she has a boyfriend.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s news all right. Who?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jerry Sparks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That loser? What does she see in him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s quite a good electrician.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When he&#x2019;s not high on something.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I called LeRoy Watts this afternoon for a small problem,&#x201d; said Victoria.<br>&#x201c;Electrical problem?&#x201d; Elizabeth glanced at her grandmother with concern.<br>&#x201c;Minor,&#x201d; Victoria assured her. &#x201c;LeRoy is coming by on Monday to fix it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Our guest used a hair dryer in the upstairs outlet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And tripped the circuit breaker,&#x201d; Elizabeth finished. &#x201c;We need to have that room rewired.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;LeRoy&#x2019;s taking care of it. He told me he&#x2019;d fired Jerry Sparks. I didn&#x2019;t know whether Emily knew or not. She seems very fond of him.&#x201d;<br>Elizabeth made a wry face. &#x201c;Poor Emily. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s ever had a steady boyfriend before.&#x201d;<br>They&#x2019;d reached the edge of the state forest and Victoria gazed at the silvery snags of dead pine trees, beautiful in an austere way. She mulled over the first lines of a poem she might write. A villanelle, with its interesting rhyme scheme, would lend itself to the starkness of the scene.<br>&#x201c;Jerry Sparks is a leech,&#x201d; said Elizabeth, breaking into Victoria&#x2019;s thoughts. &#x201c;Emily&#x2019;s na�ve and not terribly bright, and he&#x2019;s taking advantage of her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>After he&#x2019;d made a note to stop by Victoria Trumbull&#x2019;s on Monday to check that electrical outlet, LeRoy Watts prepared to leave for the day. It was a pleasant evening, a Thursday. Weekend coming up. Maybe he&#x2019;d go fishing on Saturday. The stripers were running at South Beach.<br>The back door of the shop slammed.<br>Heavy, unsteady footsteps trudged into the showroom from the back entrance. LeRoy smiled. One of his sons pretending to be Godzilla or something. He looked up and his smile faded.<br>&#x201c;So. It&#x2019;s you, Sparks. What are you doing here? I told you I don&#x2019;t want to see you again.&#x201d;<br>Jerry Sparks&#x2019;s voice was slurred, the pupils of his eyes were tiny black dots. He was wearing a grimy knitted headband of an indeterminate color and an equally grimy green hooded sweatshirt. &#x201c;I want my job back, man.&#x201d;<br>LeRoy retreated to the counter. &#x201c;Sorry, Sparks. I warned you. No drugs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, man,&#x201d; Sparks whined. &#x201c;I need money.&#x201d; He edged farther into the showroom. &#x201c;Taking my girl out tonight.&#x201d;<br>The one-way traffic on Circuit Avenue moved slowly past the shop.

A school assignment leads these 1950s teens to an abandoned theater in the heart of their hometown, New Zebedee, where Lewis finds sheet music inside an old piano?and a ghost, who warns him, "Beware the doom of the haunted opera!" The whole town gets involved in staging the opera, and a stranger shows up to watch the action. Henry Vanderhelm claims to be the composer's grandson, but when New Zebedee is suddenly cut off from the outside world, a horrid suspicion dawns on Lewis. Vanderhelm is the composer himself?and the opera is really an elaborate spell designed to make him King of the Dead and enable him to take over the world. Lewis and Rose Rita are bright and likable protagonists. Other characters are equally well drawn, especially the evil Vanderhelm and the mistake-prone would-be magician, Mrs. Jaeger, a neighbor who helps the young people. The action moves quickly; tension escalates nicely, and Lewis gets a boost of confidence from a surprising source when things look bleakest.

With William Butler Yeats and others, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. She also produced a number of books of retellings of stories from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced in these writings, was emblematic of many of the changes to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.<br><br>Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind Irish Literary Revival. Her home at Coole Park, County Galway served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important for the theatre's development as her creative writings.

Now, after having spent additional countless hours in deep study of the topic with co-author David Krutchkoff, DDS, MS, &#34;The Silent Saboteurs&#34; is here to expand on this groundbreaking subject. IN THE AUTHORS&#39; OWN WORDS: &#34;This is a story about a very special group of bacteria; uniquely different and interesting microbes that live within our mouths. These peculiar forms of life, known collectively as oral spirochetes, are unknown to most and misunderstood by nearly all. We have a story to tell concerning a proposed role these microbes play as saboteurs of our body defenses if allowed to penetrate our external surfaces thereby gaining access to the forbidden territory of our vulnerable internal body fluids. The ways, means and hows, are going to be presented along with rationales and suggestions of strategies by which these bacteria can be countered and what this will mean in terms of a better overall quality of life and savings to our health-care system.

This book collects small dishes from countries like India, Japan and Bali, offering seafood-heavy selections such as Fresh Salmon Salad Rolls and Spicy Fish Cakes with Coconut and Coriander. Poultry, pork and beef also have a strong presence, appearing in Malaysian Beef Satays with Spicy Peanut Sauce and a Smoked Turkey and Green Mango Salad. Apart from the expected rolls, salads and skewers, the book also covers creative sweet dishes like playful Fruit Cookie Lollipops and a time-intensive Coconut Pannacotta with Lavender Jelly, Mangosteen Meringue and Melted Chocolate. Every recipe is photographed in full color and presented in a beautiful, extravagant manner that will challenge all but the most artistically inclined cooks. Home cooks, meanwhile, may struggle just to find the ingredients. Many items are only available in specialty ethnic markets and some, such as the wagyu or sukiyaki beef in Japanese Beef Salad Rolls, are highly expensive. In addition, the authors don&#x2019;t always offer substitution suggestions. Delicious as many of these dishes appear, all but the most intrepid chefs will probably prefer to try them at a restaurant, leaving the preparation to expert chefs with fully-stocked pantries.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She is best known for the three children's novels Little Lord Fauntleroy (published in 1885&#x2013;1886), A Little Princess (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911). Frances Eliza Hodgson was born in Cheetham, England. After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 immigrated to the United States, settling near Knoxville, Tennessee. There Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines from the age of 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 Frances married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to live in Washington, D.C., Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (That Lass o' Lowrie's), was published to good reviews. Little Lord Fauntleroy was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children's fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped to produce stage versions of Little Lord Fauntleroy and A Little Princess. Burnett enjoyed socializing and lived a lavish lifestyle. Beginning in the 1880s, she began to travel to England frequently and in the 1890s bought a home there where she wrote The Secret Garden. Her oldest son, Lionel, died of tuberculosis in 1890, which caused a relapse of the depression she had struggled with for much of her life. She divorced Swan Burnett in 1898, married Stephen Townsend in 1900, and divorced him in 1902. A few years later she settled in Nassau County, Long Island, where she died in 1924 and is buried in Roslyn Cemetery. In 1936 a memorial sculpture by Bessie Potter Vonnoh was erected in her honour in Central Park's Conservatory Garden. The statue depicts her two famous Secret Garden characters, Mary and Dickon.</p><h2>The Story of Robin Hood</h2><p>Recounts the life and adventures of Robin Hood, who, with his band of followers, lived in Sherwood Forest as an outlaw dedicated to fighting tyranny.</p><p>Robert Leeson is a contributor for Kingfisher titles including: &#39;The Story of Robin Hood&#39;</p><h2>BARNETT NEWMAN.

However, this dominant system, from which Americans obtain most of their food, is being slowly supplanted by a new paradigm.</p><p><i>The Emergent Agriculture</i> is a collection of fourteen thematic essays on sustainability viewed through the lens of farming.

She never considered writing professionally until May of 2009. Since then, she hasn't gone a day without writing. <i>Tempest</i> was her first novel.</p>CHAPTER ONE<br>&nbsp;<br><br>JUNE 8, 2009, 6:30 A.M.<br>I could hear my heart pounding, even over the volume of the helicopter. Judging distance and memorizing images of our surroundings were skills I&#x2019;d learned to use to my advantage during the past two and a half months of Tempest training. But today they had taken away my sight. And by &#x201c;they,&#x201d; I mean Chief Marshall.<br>After an hour of their obvious diversions and turning the helicopter in circles to confuse us, I was seriously ready for a time jump&nbsp;... somewhere calm and on the ground.<br>&#x201c;In about sixty seconds,&#x201d; Freeman barked over the noise of the helicopter, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you the coordinates of our location, the door will open, and both of you will be dangling by those ropes we&#x2019;ve attached you to. Your chance of survival will increase greatly if you have an idea of what your feet might land on.&#x201d;<br><i>Awesome.</i><br>I fought the urge to rip off my blindfold and look down. Without seeing the journey we&#x2019;d taken, I&#x2019;d never be able to figure out where they were about to dump us. Agent Kendrick was already shaking beside me. I couldn&#x2019;t see her, but I felt her shoulder trembling as it pressed against mine.<br>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; I whispered into her ear. &#x201c;Or it&#x2019;ll only get worse.&#x201d;<br>My heart slowed instantly as I used my own advice for Kendrick on myself. Never let anyone see you sweat. Never let them in your head&nbsp;... not Chief Marshall, not my partner or any of the Tempest trainees, and especially not the EOTs. This was one of the three most important lessons I&#x2019;d learned in training. The other two:<br>Everything is a test.<br>Everyone is alone.<br>The sound of the helicopter door being wrenched open caused my stomach to drop. <i>Calm&nbsp;... stay calm</i>. Noise from the rotors and wind burst in, cold air smacking me in the face.<br>I barely heard Freeman shout the coordinates, and then I heard Kendrick yell into my ear, &#x201c;The east side of the French Alps&nbsp;... rough surface&nbsp;... loose rocks&nbsp;... but people climb it.&#x201d;<br>I swallowed hard. &#x201c;Great.&#x201d;<br>And they literally <i>had</i> turned us in circles since we&#x2019;d left this morning, considering Tempest headquarters were at the base of the French Alps.<br>Ten seconds later, Kendrick and I were being pushed through the open door, each secured to our own rope as we swung back and forth in the wind.<br>&#x201c;Jackson!&#x201d; Kendrick shouted. &#x201c;Take off your blindfold.&#x201d;<br>Oh&nbsp;... right. But that would require peeling my fingers from the rope. Instead of releasing a hand, I used my forearm to nudge the cloth from my eyes. The sun blinded me at first and then I looked down as the mountain swung in and out of focus. &#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d;<br>Kendrick&#x2019;s long dark hair whipped in the wind as her eyes scanned the mountainside. She didn&#x2019;t look nearly as petrified as I felt. I had a feeling her genius mind was spinning too fast to let fear distract her. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a ledge&nbsp;... we&#x2019;re gonna have to jump a little&nbsp;... doesn&#x2019;t quite reach the end of the rope&nbsp;... but I don&#x2019;t know how long before they cut us off from above.&#x201d;<br>I glanced up at the helicopter, still hovering ten feet over us, Freeman ready to untie us and slam the door shut any second now. &#x201c;Okay, ready when you are.&#x201d;<br>We quickly worked our way down the forty-foot ropes, but even Kendrick hesitated at the end, our feet dangling, trying to reach the small ledge, but coming up short by about five feet. We&#x2019;d have to unhook the clips securing us to the ropes in order to land on the ledge.<br>Today&#x2019;s test, in terms of explaining the rules to the trainees, was the most simple we&#x2019;d had so far&#x2014;blindfolded journey where we&#x2019;d be left alone with our partners, and all we had to do was find our way back to headquarters. It was a timed test, of course, but the rules were simple. The execution, however&nbsp;... not so simple.<br>&#x201c;On the count of three,&#x201d; Kendrick said, her eyes meeting mine.<br>And for a second I had to wonder if this was a different test. Like maybe I was supposed to con her into going first. Or I&#x2019;d release myself from the rope and she wouldn&#x2019;t, and then they&#x2019;d pull her back up to safety and take off without me.<br><i>Only one way to find out</i>.<br>&#x201c;One, two,&#x201d; I said, gripping the release button on the clip between my fingers. &#x201c;Three!&#x201d;<br>The blur of Kendrick falling beside me obscured my vision, and the surface of the mountain appeared before I was ready for it. The side of my face smacked into a jagged rock, immediately followed by the warm trickle of blood dripping down my cheek. My feet found the flat surface and both Kendrick and I pressed our hips into the mountain, toes turned out.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got pitons&nbsp;... in our bags, right?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Kendrick said between breaths. &#x201c;Jackson&nbsp;... you&#x2019;re bleeding.&#x201d;<br>As she reached for my forehead, I shrank away from her hand and quickly wiped the blood with the sleeve of my T-shirt. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine. Forget it.&#x201d;<br>She pulled her hand back and looked at the large rock in front of us. &#x201c;Can you reach in your bag and hand me a piton?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have your own?&#x201d;<br>She held up the end of a rope, which I hadn&#x2019;t even noticed had been thrown from the helicopter. &#x201c;They only gave us one rope. We&#x2019;re gonna have to share it.&#x201d;<br>The challenge in her eyes was too obvious to miss. &#x201c;Then hand it to me and I&#x2019;ll tie it for both of us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On what? You&#x2019;ve got nothing but loose rocks in front of you.&#x201d;<br>I remained silent as I handed her a piton and watched her pound it into the mountain. She tugged hard on the rope and then reached for my harness, clipping me to the rope before I could object.<br>&#x201c;This should hold both of us,&#x201d; she said.<br>My fingers held tightly to the edge of a rock. &#x201c;You first.&#x201d;<br>Kendrick shrugged and then started her descent. My eyes dropped to the ground again without permission and Kendrick&#x2019;s face dissolved. A flash of Holly&#x2019;s blond hair flying toward the ground materialized in front of me. Blood pumped in my ears and the air in my lungs seemed to vanish. <i>Not this. Not now. Focus!</i><br>&#x201c;Jackson?&#x201d; Kendrick said from a few feet below me. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;<br><i>No</i>. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br>I turned around quickly and stared straight at the slab of rock in front of me, then started to climb down. Kendrick moved in silence below me for the next hour. The effort of securing pitons and retying the rope every twenty feet was exhausting and made conversation difficult.<br>The valleys below us were still distant green blobs when Kendrick finally spoke again. &#x201c;I love how you&#x2019;re still trying to hide the fact that you&#x2019;re an acrophobe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So it seems,&#x201d; I said, looking down at her. I almost laughed when I saw her eyes roll.<br>&#x201c;Anyway, I was just thinking&nbsp;... since I don&#x2019;t really have an issue with heights&nbsp;... it&#x2019;s good that we&#x2019;ve been paired together.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right, you got me,&#x201d; I said, keeping my focus straight ahead. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared of falling off this mountain&nbsp;... and it&#x2019;s not like you weren&#x2019;t shaking up there in the helicopter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t worried about the height. I was afraid I wouldn&#x2019;t have the answer, wouldn&#x2019;t have a clue where we were. Being lost freaks me out.&#x201d;<br><i>Okay&nbsp;... so what? We&#x2019;re gonna get personal now? Talk about our hopes and dreams&nbsp;... great fears? Yeah, right.</i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Finally, after hours of climbing, we reached less vertical terrain. Agent Kendrick and I unhooked our rope and stuffed everything into our backpacks. When I looked around at our surroundings, I could hardly believe my eyes. &#x201c;This is right near headquarters.&#x201d;<br>Kendrick nodded, smiling a little.<br>&#x201c;Did you know where we&#x2019;d end up when you picked our landing spot?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t help asking, and sounding slightly impressed, which I was.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;But not right away. It was a good guess. And now maybe we can pass the test and record the fastest return time. I&#x2019;d love to win a day off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Impressive,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not just trying to live through this, but also attempting to win. Did you see anyone else?&#x201d;<br>She swept the area with her eyes, then sighed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re either way ahead or way behind&nbsp;... Damn, this place is beautiful. This is where I want to go for my honeymoon. In one of those little villas right at the base of the Alps.&#x201d;<br>I nodded in the direction of the underground pathway. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s win Marshall&#x2019;s contest first and plan honeymoons later.&#x201d;<br><i>Honeymoon? Seriously?</i><br>We raced toward the secret entrance and shifted the giant stacks of hay to the side. Both of us grinned, knowing we were most likely the first to come through. It would have been impossible to push the hay back after crawling into the hole.<br>&#x201c;I already know what I&#x2019;m going to do with my day off,&#x201d; Kendrick said. &#x201c;Eat&nbsp;... and eat&nbsp;... pastries&nbsp;... lots of pastries.&#x201d;<br>My foot was already feeling around for the ladder, excitement and adrenaline rushing through my veins.<br>I lifted my eyes to look at my partner and nearly shouted as several figures, blurred by the sun&#x2019;s glare, appeared around us. Kendrick&#x2019;s shout was muffled instantly. A strange, almost metallic-smelling gas filled my nostrils, and then a foot made contact with the side of my head and my vision completely dissolved.<br>The thud of my head smacking the gr...</p><h2>The Moon</h2><p>Since the dawn of time, the moon has exerted a tremendous influence over the earth and its inhabitants, both scientifically and artistically. The earliest astronomers expended much energy in their attempts to map the moon and imagine what it must be like to travel there, and globally the moon has a central role in virtually all mythologies, from Amazonian Indians to the ancient Egyptians to the Celts. Poets, painters and musicians have taken the moon as the inspiration for great extraordinary works of art. The myriad of stories - peopled with extraordinary characters like Galileo, the 12th century monk Gervase of Canterbury and Van Eyck - and fascinating science which this tale comprises have now been brought together in this volume.</p><p>Dr David Whitehouse is the BBC&#39;s Science Correspondent and also writes regularly for magazines and newspapers such as the New Scientist and the Independent. He has worked for NASA, is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and the president of the UK&#39;s Society for Popular Astronomy.Hard on the heels of the &#34;biography&#34; of the famous Einstein equation E=MC2 comes a similar history, this time of our famous natural satellite. This account of the moon is by an award-winning BBC science correspondent, whose expertise shines through in a wide-ranging and authoritative account, drawing together many disparate threads. Since pre-history, the moon has fascinated man, exerting a tremendous influence over the earth and its inhabitants. It has had a central role for most cultures and their poets, painters and musicians as well as lovers have taken it as a source of inspiration. Whitehouse&#39;s book brings together these various aspects in elegant and informed prose, ranging in time from the Moonwatchers of Lascaux and the awe of primitive man, on to Galileo, Van Eyck and Thomas Harriot (an unfairly neglected British moon-scientist), then ultimately the Apollo Missions of the 1970s and 1980s. The result is a rich and unusual survey, one that should please specialists and non-specialists alike. One to observe closely.</p><h2>The adventurous gardener</h2><p>This guide to experimental gardening leads the reader through such tasks as pruning, diagnosing diseases, cultivating, taking cuttings, and preparing for winter</p><p>The best gardening is experimental as well as ephemeral, Christopher Lloyd writes.

One interesting theme is the loss of traditional ways of life to modern development, which at one point creates havoc with Lewis's need for a peaceful location for writing. Lewis's voyages, which encompass Spain, Cuba, India, Peru, and Italy, are tied together with fragments of his life; though the focus is always on places visited and people met, glimpses of the traveler do come through, revealing a complex and intelligent man. This book will be popular with a variety of readers.

The photographs in &#39;Fish-Work: The Bering Sea&#39; capture moments from Arnold&#39;s grueling retreats as a crew member aboard a fishing boat to the Bering Sea. With scenes of boat life so vivid that some shots can induce fear or seasickness, the artist&#39;s perspective also reveals the tender soulfulness of a fisherman&#39;s extended life at sea. His skillful compositions depict the simultaneous bravery, toil, humor and gumption that &#39;fish-work&#39; demands. Yet the series also illuminates the aesthetic sublimity that can only be experienced, ultimately, by those willing to risk their lives where the sea breaks its back. Having survived several seasons afloat these icy and unforgiving waters, we are lucky that Arnold has taken time to document his artistic impressions of this rare lifestyle and extended us a vicarious glimpse. Corey Arnold&#39;s work has been exhibited worldwide. Recent publications featuring Arnold&#39;s work include the Juxtapoz Photo Book, Esquire, The Sunday Telegraph, Rolling Stone, Outside, The Paris Review, and PDN&#39;s 30. &#39;Fish-Work: The Bering Sea&#39; is printed in an oversized format in a first edition of 1,000 casebound copies.</p><p></p><h2>The Crazy Game: How I Survived in the Crease and Beyond</h2><p><p><strong>In the spirit of <em>The Game</em> and <em>The Blind Side</em>, a raw, raucous and unvarnished look at life between the posts.</strong><br><br>No job in the world of sports is as intimidating, exhilarating and as stress-ridden as that of a hockey goaltender. Standing in the crease facing one-hundred-mile-an-hour slapshots, the entire game riding on your glove hand, standing on your head when necessary-all job requirements for those wanting to be the best goalies in the world.

Even as a boy, Malarchuk faced such deep anxiety that he missed school and acted out at school and with his friends. His OCD changed the way he trained, and he was almost always the last player off the ice. When his throat was slashed during a collision in the crease, Malarchuk nearly died on the ice. Forever changed, he struggled deeply with depression and a dependence on alcohol, which nearly cost him his life and left a bullet in his head.</p></p><p><p><strong>CLINT MALARCHUK</strong> was a goaltender with the Quebec Nordiques, Washington Capitals and Buffalo Sabres.

The author of over 25 books, he lives in Moscow. Doubleday Canada will publish the fourth installment in the series, <b>The Last Watch</b>, in 2008.PROLOGUE<br><br>The genuine old communal courtyards in Moscow&#x2019;s apartment blocks disappeared sometime between the eras of the two popular bards Vysotsky and Okudzhava.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a strange business. Even after the revolution, when for purposes of the struggle against &#x2018;the slavery of the kitchen&#x2019;, they actually did away with kitchens in housing blocks, nobody tried to get rid of the courtyards. Every proud Stalinist block that displayed its Potemkin fa�ade to the broad avenue beside it had to have a courtyard &#x2014; large and green, with tables and benches, with a yard-keeper scraping the asphalt clean every morning. Then the age of five-storey sectional housing arrived &#x2014; and the courtyards shrivelled and became bare, the yard-keepers who had been so grave and staid were replaced by yard women, who regarded it as their duty to give little boys who got up to mischief a clip round the ear and upbraid residents who came home drunk. But even so, the courtyards still hung on.<br><br>And then, as if in response to the increased tempo of life, the houses stretched upwards. From nine storeys to sixteen, or even twenty-four. And as if each building was allocated the right only to a certain volume of space, rather than an area of ground, the courtyards withered right back to the entrances and the entrances opened their doors straight onto the public streets, while the male and female yard-keepers disappeared and were replaced by communal services functionaries.<br><br>Okay, so the courtyards came back later, but by no means to all the buildings, as if they&#x2019;d taken offence at being treated so scornfully before. The new courtyards were bounded by high walls, with fit, well-groomed young men sitting in the gate lodges, and car parks concealed under the English lawns. The children in these courtyards played under the supervision of nannies, the drunken residents were helped from their Mercedes and BMWs by bodyguards accustomed to dealing with anything, and the new yard-keepers tidied up the English lawns with German mowers.<br><br>This courtyard was one of the new ones.<br><br>The multistorey towers on the bank of the River Moscow were known throughout Russia. They were the capital&#x2019;s new symbol &#x2014; replacing the faded Kremlin and the TsUM department store, which had become just an ordinary shop. The granite embankment with its own quayside, the entrances finished with Venetian plasterwork, the caf�s and restaurants, the beauty salons and supermarkets and also, of course, the apartments with two or three hundred square metres of floor space. The new Russia probably needed a symbol like this &#x2014; pompous and kitschy, like the thick gold chains that men wore round their necks during the period of initial accumulation of capital. And it didn&#x2019;t matter that most of the apartments that had been bought long ago were still standing empty, the caf�s and restaurants were closed, waiting for better times to come, and the waves lapping against the concrete quayside were dirty.<br><br>The man strolling along the embankment on this warm summer evening had never worn a gold chain. He possessed a keen in-tuition that was more than adequate as a substitute for good taste. He had switched his Chinese-made Adidas tracksuit in good time for a crimson club jacket and then been the first to ditch the crimson jacket in favour of a Versace suit. He was ahead of the game even in the sports that he played, having abandoned his tennis racket for mountain skis a whole month before all the Kremlin officials ... even though at his age the pleasure he could get from skis was limited to standing on them.<br><br>He preferred to live in his mansion house in the Gorki-9 district, only visiting the apartment with the windows overlooking the river when he was with his lover.<br><br>But then, he was planning to get rid of his full-time lover &#x2014; after all, no Viagra can conquer age, and conjugal fidelity was coming back into fashion.<br><br>His driver and bodyguards weren&#x2019;t standing near enough to hear what their employer was saying. But even if the wind did carry snatches of his words to their ears, what was so strange? Why shouldn&#x2019;t a man make conversation with himself as the working day was drawing to a close, standing all alone above the dancing waves? Where could you ever find a more sympathetic listener than your own self?<br><br>&#x2018;Even so, I repeat my proposal ...&#x2019; the man said. &#x2018;I repeat it yet again.&#x2019;<br><br>The stars were shining dimly through the city smog. On the far bank of the river, tiny lights were coming on in the tower blocks that had no courtyards. Only one in five of the beautiful lamps stretching along the quayside was lit &#x2014; and that was only to humour the whim of the important man who had decided to take a stroll by the river.<br><br>&#x2018;I repeat it yet again,&#x2019; the man said in a quiet voice.<br><br>The water splashed against the embankment &#x2014; and with it came the answer.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s impossible. Absolutely impossible.&#x2019;<br><br>The man on the quayside was not surprised by the voice that came out of empty space. He nodded and asked:<br><br>&#x2018;But what about vampires?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, that&#x2019;s one possibility,&#x2019; his invisible companion agreed. &#x2018;Vampires could initiate you. If you would be happy to exist as non-life ... I won&#x2019;t lie, they don&#x2019;t like sunlight, but it&#x2019;s not fatal to them, and you wouldn&#x2019;t have to give up risotto with garlic ...&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Then what&#x2019;s the problem?&#x2019; the man asked, involuntarily raising his hands to his chest. &#x2018;The soul? The need to drink blood?&#x2019;<br><br>The void laughed quietly.<br><br>&#x2018;Just the hunger. Eternal hunger. And the emptiness inside. You wouldn&#x2019;t like it, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What else is there?&#x2019; asked the man.<br><br>&#x2018;Werewolves,&#x2019; the voice replied almost jocularly. &#x2018;They can initiate a man too. But werewolves are also one of the lower forms of Dark Others. Most of the time everything&#x2019;s fine ... but when the frenzy comes over you, you won&#x2019;t be able to control yourself. Three or four nights each month. Sometimes more, sometimes less.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The new moon,&#x2019; the man said with an understanding nod.<br><br>The void laughed again:<br><br>&#x2018;No. Werewolves&#x2019; frenzies aren&#x2019;t linked to the lunar cycle. You&#x2019;d be able to sense the onset of the madness ten or twelve hours before the moment of transformation. But no one can draw up a precise timetable for you.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That won&#x2019;t do,&#x2019; the man said frostily. &#x2018;I repeat my ... request. I wish to become an Other. Not one of the lower Others who are overwhelmed by fits of bestial insanity. Not a Great Magician, involved in great affairs. A perfectly ordinary, rank-and-file Other ... how does that classification of yours go? Seventh-grade?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s impossible,&#x2019; the night replied. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t have the abilities of an Other. Not even the slightest trace. If you have no musical talent, you can be taught to play the violin. You can become a sportsman, even if you don&#x2019;t have any natural aptitude for it. But you can&#x2019;t become an Other. You&#x2019;re simply a different species. I&#x2019;m very sorry.&#x2019;<br><br>The man on the embankment laughed:<br><br>&#x2018;Nothing is ever impossible. If the lowest form of Other is able to initiate human beings, then there must be some way a man can be turned into a magician.&#x2019;<br><br>The dark night said nothing.<br><br>&#x2018;In any case, I didn&#x2019;t say I wanted to be a Dark Other. I don&#x2019;t have the slightest desire to drink innocent people&#x2019;s blood and go chasing virgins through the fields, or laugh ghoulishly as I lay a curse on someone,&#x2019; the man said testily. &#x2018;I would much rather do good deeds ... and in general, your internal squabbles mean absolutely nothing to me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That ...&#x2019; the night began wearily.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s your problem,&#x2019; the man replied. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m giving you one week. And then I want an answer to my request.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Request?&#x2019; the night queried.<br><br>The man on the embankment smiled:<br><br>&#x2018;Yes. So far I&#x2019;m only asking.&#x2019;<br><br>He turned and walked towards his car &#x2014; a Russian Volga, the model that would be back in fashion again in about six months.<br><br><b><br>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br>Even if you love your job, the last day of holiday always makes you feel depressed. Just one week earlier I&#x2019;d been sunning myself on a nice clean Spanish beach, eating paella (to be quite honest, Uzbeki pilaff is better), drinking cold sangria in a little Chinese restaurant (how come the Chinese make the Spanish national drink better than the natives do?) and buying all sorts of rubbishy resort souvenirs in the shops.<br><br>But now it was summer in Moscow again &#x2014; not exactly hot, but stifling and oppressive. And it was that final day of holiday, when you can&#x2019;t get your mind to relax any more, but it flatly refuses to function properly.<br><br>Maybe that was why I was glad when I got the call from Gesar.<br><br>&#x2018;Good morning, Anton,&#x2019; the boss began, without introducing himself. &#x2018;Welcome back. Did you know it was me?&#x2019;<br><br>I&#x2019;d been able to sense Gesar&#x2019;s calls for some time already. It was as if the ringing of the phone changed subtly, becoming more demanding and authoritative.<br><br>But I was in no rush to let the boss know that.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, Boris Ignatievich.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Are you alone?&#x2019;<br><br>An unnecessary question. I was certain Gesar knew perfectly well where Svetlana was just then.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes. The girls are at the dacha.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Good for them,&#x2019; the boss sighed at the other end of the line, and an entirely human note appeared in his voice. &#x2018;Olga flew off on holiday this morning too ... half the Watch staff are relaxing in southern climes ... Do you think you could call round to the office straight away?&#x2019;<br><br>Before I had time to answer, Gesar went on cheerily.<br><br>&#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s excellent! See you in forty minutes then.&#x2019;<br><br>I really felt like calling Gesar a cheap poser &#x2014; after I hung up, of course. But I kept my mouth shut. In the first place, the boss could hear what I said without any need of a telephone. And in the second &#x2014; whatever else he might be, he was no cheap poser. He just didn&#x2019;t like wasting time. If I was about to say I&#x2019;d be there in forty minutes, what was the point in listening to me say it?<br><br>And anyway, I was really glad I&#x2019;d got the call. The day was already shot to hell in any case. It was still too early to tidy up the apartment &#x2014; like any self-respecting man whose family is away, I only do that once, on the final day of bachelor life. And I def-initely didn&#x2019;t feel like going round to see anyone or inviting anyone back to my place. So by far the most useful thing would be to go back to work a day early &#x2014; that way, I could ask for time off with a clear conscience when I needed to.<br><br>Even though it wasn&#x2019;t the done thing for us to ask for time off.<br><br>&#x2018;Thanks, boss,&#x2019; I said with real feeling. I detached myself from the armchair, put down the book I hadn&#x2019;t finished, and stretched.<br><br>And then the phone rang again.<br><br>Of course, it would have been just like Gesar to ring and say: &#x2018;You&#x2019;re welcome!&#x2019; But that definitely would have been cheap clowning.<br><br>&#x2018;Hello!&#x2019; I said in a very businesslike tone.<br><br>&#x2018;Anton, it&#x2019;s me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sveta,&#x2019; I said, sitting back down again. And suddenly I tensed up &#x2014; Svetlana&#x2019;s voice sounded uneasy. Anxious. &#x2018;Sveta, has something happened to Nadya?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x2019; she replied quickly. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry. Why don&#x2019;t you tell me how you&#x2019;ve been getting on?&#x2019;<br><br>I thought for a few seconds. I hadn&#x2019;t had any drinking parties, I hadn&#x2019;t brought any women back home, I wasn&#x2019;t drowning in refuse, I&#x2019;d even been washing the dishes ...<br><br>And then I realised.<br><br>&#x2018;Gesar called. Just a moment ago.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What does he want?&#x2019; Svetlana asked quickly.<br><br>&#x2018;Nothing special. He asked me to turn up for work today.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Anton, I sensed something. Something bad. Did you agree? Are you going to work?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why not? I&#x2019;ve got nothing else to do.&#x2019;<br><br>Svetlana was silent. Then she said reluctantly:<br><br>&#x2018;You know, I felt a sort of pricking in my heart. Do you believe I can sense trouble?&#x2019;<br><br>I laughed:<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, Great One.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Anton, be serious, will you!&#x2019; Svetlana was instantly uptight, the way she always got when I called her Great One. &#x2018;Listen to me ... if Gesar asks you to do something, say no.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sveta, if Gesar called me in, it means he wants to ask me to do something. It means he needs help. He says everyone&#x2019;s on holiday ...&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;He needs more cannon fodder,&#x2019; Svetlana snapped. &#x2018;Anton ... never mind, you won&#x2019;t listen to me anyway. Just be careful.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sveta, you don&#x2019;t seriously think that Gesar&#x2019;s going to put me in any danger, do you?&#x2019; I said cautiously. &#x2018;I understand the way you feel about him ...&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Be careful,&#x2019; said Svetlana. &#x2018;For our sake. All right?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; I promised. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m always very careful.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll call if I sense anything else,&#x2019; said Svetlana. She seemed to have calmed down a bit. &#x2018;And you call, all right? If anything at all unusual happens, call. Okay?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Okay, I&#x2019;ll call.&#x2019;<br><br>Svetlana paused for a few seconds, then before she hung up, she said:<br><br>&#x2018;You ought to leave the Watch, third-grade Light Magician ...&#x2019;<br><br>It all ended on a suspiciously cheerful note, with a cheap jibe ... Although we had agreed a long time ago not to discuss that subject &#x2014; three years earlier, when Svetlana left the Night Watch. And we hadn&#x2019;t broken our promise once. Of course. I used to tell my wife about my work ... at least, about the jobs that I wanted to remember. And she always listened with interest. But now she had come right out with it.<br>Could she really have sensed something bad?<br><br>Anyway, I got ready to go slowly and reluctantly. I put on a suit, then changed into jeans and a checked shirt, then thought &#x2018;to hell with it!&#x2019; and got into my shorts and a black T-shirt with an inscription that said: &#x2018;My friend was clinically dead, but all he brought me from the next world was this T-shirt!&#x2019; I might look like a German tourist, but at least I would retain the semblance of a holiday mood in front of Gesar.<br><br>Eventually I left the building with just twenty minutes to spare. I had to flag down a car and feel out the probability lines &#x2014; and then tell the driver which streets to take so we wouldn&#x2019;t hit any traffic jams.<br>The driver accepted my instructions hesitantly, he obviously had serious doubts.<br><br>But we got there on time.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>The lifts weren&#x2019;t working &#x2014; there were guys in blue overalls loading them with paper sacks of cement. I set off up the stairs on foot, and discovered that the second floor of our office was being refurbished. There were workmen lining the walls with sheets of plasterboard, and plasterers bustling about beside them, filling in the seams. At the same time they were installing a false ceiling, which already covered the air-conditioning pipes.</p><h2>Kitchen Essays</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Born in the early 1900s, he lives through multiple centuries, his love for time ultimately causing him to become his own ancestor. Time Enough for Love is his lovingly detailed account of his journey through a vast and magnificent timescape of centuries and worlds. Using the voice of Lazarus, Heinlein expounds his own philosophies, including his radical ideas on sexual freedom. His use of slang, technical jargon, sharp wit, and clever understatement lend this story a texture and authority that seems the very tone of things to come.</p><p>Robert Anson Heinlein was born in Missouri in 1907, and was raised there. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p>Sure, there's time enough for love...but who has time enough to get through 281/2 hours of a novel as dull as this? It opens 22 centuries in the future, when the ruler of a remote colony planet tries to keep 2000-year-old Lazarus Long from committing suicide before he passes on what he has learned. What follows is a very talky book, comprised mostly of Long's reminiscences. Curious about his possible blood ties to almost everyone he encounters, Long talks at length about genetics, but what he says now seems absurdly out-of-date, thanks to recent developments in DNA fingerprinting. When this book first appeared in 1973, it was hailed as one of Heinlein's masterworks the capstone to his future history cycle. Now it creaks with age, leaving listeners to marvel at how quickly the future can grow stale. Lloyd James's reading injects some life into the story but not enough to make it a worthwhile acquisition to any but well-funded sf collections. R.

Inside is the full text of the original novel, with decorations by Mary GrandPr�.<br></i><br>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the pivotal fourth novel in the seven-part tale of Harry Potter&#x2019;s training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream). He wants to find out about the mysterious event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn&#x2019;t happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he&#x2019;s not normal &#x2014; even by wizarding standards.<br><br>And in this case, different can be deadly.<br><br></p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

How can we attain true happiness? How are we to understand the concepts of good, bad, right, wrong, virtue, and vice as they intermingle and pervade the human actions that make up society? In one of the earliest and most comprehensive attempts to offer a systematic treatment of ethics and the principles upon which it rests, the Greek philosopher Aristotle seeks to give substance and meaning to human action and to the manner in which we judge our own behavior and that of others. Here Aristotle not only offers a discussion of morality that later culminated in a full-blown analysis of political life, but he also sets forth principles and advice that served as the touchstone for many subsequent moral philosophies.</p><p><b>ARISTOTLE</b>&nbsp;was born in the northern Greek town of Stagira in 384 B.C.E., where his father was the personal physician to the great-grandfather of Alexander the Great. At the age of eighteen Aristotle entered Plato's Academy and soon became recognized as its most important student. He<b>&nbsp;</b>remained under Plato's tutelage for nearly twenty years.<br><br>After his teacher's death in 347 B.C.E., Aristotle cultivated associations with other Academy students throughout Greece and Asia Minor. Then in 342 B.C.E., Aristotle was asked by King Philip II of Macedonia to become the tutor for his young son Alexander, who was later to become the conqueror of much of the known world at that time. The young prince remained under Aristotle's supervision until 336 B.C.E., when he acceded to the throne after his father's death. Two years later Aristotle returned to Athens and founded his own school, which he called the Lyceum. This intellectual center flourished during the years when Alexander the Great ruled Greece as part of his large empire. But upon Alexander's death in 323 B.C.E., Aristotle was charged with impiety by Athenians who resented his associations with the Macedonian conqueror. Rather than risk the same fate as Plato's mentor, Socrates, Aristotle fled to the city of Chalcis, where he died in 322 B.C.E.<br><br>Aristotle's interests, like those of Plato, were diverse and his writing cast its shadow on many fields, including logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and the sciences. Among his most well-known works are:&nbsp;<i>The Categories, The Prior and Posterior Analytics, The Physics, The Meta�physics, De Anima, The Nicomachean Ethics,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Politics.</i></p><h2>Nature&#39;s Ambassador: The Legacy of Thornton W. Burgess</h2><p>For over 100 years, the animal books and stories of beloved children&#x2019;s author Thornton W. Burgess have delighted millions of children and their parents; more than of half his seventy books remain in print today. However, there was much more to Burgess, the man, than just a writer of children&#x2019;s books: he was a dedicated naturalist who was honored by prestigious scientific institutions for his advocacy of wildlife and conservation practices that resonate today. His books, syndicated columns, and radio programs both entertained and educated children, introducing them to wildlife habitat, species extinction, and roadside litter. Some books became the basis of Fables of the Green Forest, an internationally popular children&#x2019;s 1970s television cartoon. Nature&#x2019;s Ambassador explores Burgess&#x2019;s life and legacy, from his Cape Cod childhood to the present.

It makes the point that traditional values are transformative in themselves and, therefore, the best antidotes to social dysfunction.

As a Peace Corps volunteer, Carter spent two years with a rural family in a former black homeland near the Swaziland border. South Africa, in the aftermath of Nelson Mandela&#x2019;s regime-shattering election as president, is revealed in Power Lines to be a country still struggling to recover from deep racial divides. The whites live under conditions comparable to those in First-World Western countries. But black people, Carter discovered, live in another South Africa: a world of punishing poverty and unemployment, where alienation and powerlessness still prevail. Power Lines is Carter&#x2019;s story of a community&#x2019;s quest to dissolve barriers. Armed with a knowledge of Zulu and Siswati he traveled the countryside, immersing himself in the lives of blacks and whites alike. In the process, he found many on both sides who are eager to reach out to each other and heal wounds. Shaping his unique experiences into a powerful and timely volume, Carter demonstrates that even in a society as fragmented as South Africa, peoples&#x2019; desire to come together can still triumph.</p><p>Jason Carter was a teenager when he first visited Africa with his grandfather, former President Jimmy Carter, in 1987. He has since returned to Africa with the Carter Center and most recently as a Peace Corps volunteer in Lochiel, a South African town near the Swaziland border where he spent two years. He is currently attending law school at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. This is his first book.In this illuminating and textured, if pedestrian account of life in the Peace Corps, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter (who has written the introduction) shows that he, too, might be headed for high places. After graduating from college, Carter spent two years in the late 1990s volunteering in a former black homeland, as South Africa tried to build itself anew in the aftermath of apartheid. Assigned to the tiny, and poor, community of Lochiel, Carter takes the political and turns it into the personal as he writes candidly of his attempts to help create a new curriculum; he reflects on his efforts to raise teachers' self-esteem without trampling on their turf. Carter depicts life with humor and honesty and considers the limits of his stint, the way Western culture has become part of South Africans' lives and his guilt at enjoying its trappings as he travels around the country. Now a law student at the University of Georgia, Carter provides a lens on contemporary South African life that demonstrates his optimism for the future, tempered by his acknowledgment of continuing racial tension. The result will make readers sympathize with the author and empathize with the situations he describes without being maudlin. 16 pages of color photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ranma 1/2, Vol. 15</h2><p>Follows the adventures of half-boy, half-girl martial artist Ranma, whose transforming gender problems began at the Accursed Springs in China when he became cursed to turn into a girl when splashed with cold water, and back into a boy with hot water.</p><p>The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for <i>Those Selfish Aliens</i>.

Wise-guy David Prete narrates Donald Westlake's caper story, starring New York City thief Dortmunder. And nerdy-sounding Robert Fass portrays Jeffrey Deaver's twisty tale of a police statistician investigating suspicious suicides. Nothing obvious ties Carrington MacDuffie to Sharyn McCrumb's story of a slave at a medical school in pre-Civil War Georgia, but her command of voices and accent makes her a good choice. Perry's "Hostages" is preachy and farfetched, but in general this well-performed mix is solid entertainment.

Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s French detective Dupin, the hero of &#x201c;The Murders in the Rue Morgue,&#x201d; anticipated Holmes&#x2019; deductive reasoning by more than forty years with his &#x201c;tales of ratiocination.&#x201d; In <em>A Study in Scarlet</em>, the first of Holmes&#x2019; adventures, Doyle acknowledged his debt to Poe&#x2015;and to �mile Gaboriau, whose thief-turned-detective Monsieur Lecoq debuted in France twenty years earlier.<br><br> If &#x201c;Rue Morgue&#x201d; was the first true detective story in English, the title of the first full-length detective novel is more hotly contested. Two books by Wilkie Collins&#x2015;<em>The Woman in White</em> (1859) and <em>The Moonstone</em> (1868)&#x2015;are often given that honor, with the latter showing many of the features that came to identify the genre: a locked-room murder in an English country house; bungling local detectives outmatched by a brilliant amateur detective; a large cast of suspects and a plethora of red herrings; and a final twist before the truth is revealed. Others point to Mary Elizabeth Braddon&#x2019;s <em>The Trail of the Serpent</em> (1861) or <em>Aurora Floyd</em> (1862), and others still to <em>The Notting Hill Mystery</em> (1862-3) by the pseudonymous &#x201c;Charles Felix.&#x201d;<br><br> As the early years of detective fiction gave way to two separate golden ages&#x2015;of hard-boiled tales in America and intricately-plotted, so-called &#x201c;cozy&#x201d; murders in Britain&#x2015;the legacy of Sherlock Holmes, with his fierce devotion to science and logic, gave way to street smarts on the one hand and social insight on the other&#x2015;but even though these new sub-genres went their own ways, their detectives still required the intelligence and clear-sightedness that characterized the earliest works of detective fiction: the trademarks of Sherlock Holmes, and of all the detectives featured in these pages.</p><p>Graeme Davis has been fascinated by horror fiction since his teens, devouring late-night reruns of the classic Universal and Hammer movies on his parents&#x2019; black-and-white TV and stripping local thrift-stores of horror titles.

Today, the rook, named Chicken, is a member of the Woolfson family, along with a talking magpie named Spike, a baby crow named Ziki, a starling, a parrot, and others. From their elaborate bathing rituals to their springtime broodiness and tendency to cache food in the most unlikely places, these corvids share a bond with humans that one might never have imagined before reading this book.<br><br>Letting her experience speak for itself, Woolfson likens the fears and foibles of corvids to those of humans, taking into account the science of bird intelligence, evolution, song, and flight. She highlights their big personalities and capacity for affection: Chicken hates computers and machines, while she loves evening neck scratches on Woolfson&#x2019;s knee. It is through this intimate lens that Woolfson invites us to reconsider the kind of creature capable of being man&#x2019;s best friend.</p><p>Esther Woolfson was brought up in Glasgow and studied Chinese at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Edinburgh University. Her acclaimed short stories have appeared in many anthologies and have been read on Radio 4. She has won prizes both for them and for nature writing. She has been the recipient of a Scottish Arts Council Travel Grant and a Writer&#39;s Bursary. She lives in Aberdeen.Starred Review. Shortly after settling with her husband and two daughters in a rambling Edwardian house in Aberdeen, Scotland, the gift of several pairs of doves inspired UK novelist and nature writer Woolfson to convert her new coal shed into a dovecote. The doves were followed by housebirds: a cockatiel for their daughter, a flightless rosella parrot the pet store couldn&#39;t get rid of, and a succession of unfledged birds rescued by neighbors. Woolfson learned how to care for everything from infant birds to elderly parrots with dysfunctional backgrounds; the menagerie eventually includes a swearing starling, a young rook named Chicken, and Spikey the magpie. Describing how her birds communicate (nearly all the house birds talk), she reveals distinct personalities and idiosyncrasies; she also discusses birds in the wild and natural history, and her neurologist husband is particularly keen on bird brains. The highly intelligent Corvus genus, including crows, magpies, rooks and ravens, fascinate Woolfson the most, and she transmits their appeal with startling clarity. Additionally, Helen Macdonald&#39;s beautiful illustrations add resonance to each chapter&#39;s subject. A satisfying read from a masterful stylist, this will appeal to any fan of nature writing or personal essays.</p><h2>Set Fair for Roanoke: Voyages and Colonies, 1584-1606</h2><p>Quinn's study brings together the results of his nearly fifty years of research on the voyages outfitted by Sir Walter Raleigh and the efforts to colonize Roanoke Island. It is a fascinating book, rich in details of the colonists' experiences in the New World.

His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published fifty years ago and now in its sixteenth edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include The Sense of Order (1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001. He came to London in 1936 to work at the Warburg Institute, where he eventually became Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. He won numerous international honours, including a knighthood, the Order of Merit and the Goethe, Hegel and Erasmus prizes. Gifted with a powerful mind and prodigious memory, he was also an outstanding communicator, with a clear and forceful prose style. His works are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his humanism and his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.'The great gift he gave us was to make the living process of art understandable to us all. Rather than a dry cultural history, he made looking at art -- that perceptual experience -- an adventure.'<br><br>'Gombrich has done more than any other human being to draw people towards an enlightened understanding of art... Wearing his immense learning lightly, tackling abstract ideas without losing his readers in jargon, he has attracted a devoted following.'<br><br>'Ernst Gombrich was the most famous art historian in the world. His reputation was based less on a particular approach to the subject, or the mastery of a single period, than on the breadth of his interests and his skill at making the history of art interesting to a non-specialist public.'<br><br>'... did more than any other writer in the last 100 years to introduce a wider public to a love of art. Successive generations of students have been drawn to The Story of Art, his erudite survey of Western art, and his Big Idea: "There is no such thing as art -- there are only artists." An academic who stayed firmly outside his profession's charmed circle, his book was intended as a rallying cry against snobbery and elitism, and has remained a classic.'</p><h2>Data Jack (Detective Jack Stratton Mystery Thriller Series)</h2><p>Grab this hot new mystery-thriller from bestselling author Christopher Greyson.

Violent storms churn up waves and unpredictable currents capsize large vessels or cast them onto shoals and rocks where they are battered to pieces. An estimated 10,000 ships have fallen prey to the fury of the Great Lakes during the 150 years of their navigational history. This figure compares to an equal number of disasters which have occurred over the past 300 years around the British Isles. Yet despite the fascinating nature of the topic and the enormity of the problem, there has been an absence of informative published material on this theme. James P. Barry&#39;s Wrecks and Rescues of the Great Lakes fills the gap. Shipwrecks on the Great Lakes began almost as soon as there were ships to be wrecked. One of the first vessels built there by the French, the Frontenac, was wrecked in 1679. The book reveals the severity of the weather through dramatic photographs of shipwrecks, and graphic descriptions of the events surrounding them. The Victorian and Edwardian wrecks on the Canadian shore are depicted in minute detail. The photographs of the wrecks on the American side between 1881 and 1910 show the frailty of those vessels. However, the more modern ships of the &#39;20s and &#39;30s were not immune to the power of the lakes. This fact becomes increasing clear in the depiction of recent disasters and daring rescue attempts. The moving description of the tragic loss of the Edmund Fitzgerald makes the reader keenly aware of the present dangers.</p><p>Jim Barry&#39;s history of the maritime disasters of the Great Lakes is well researched and documented. It includes 149 black-and-white photographs of wrecks from the late 19th century as well as the 20th century. The author includes a comprehensive bibliography, notes, and an index. James Barry made his first voyage on a lake freighter at the age of eight, and soon afterward learned to sail in a Mackinaw boat. His interest in the Great Lakes continued through a career as a Regular Army Officer, a university administrator, director of an arts organization, and editor of a quarterly review. Seven of his previous books have dealt with various aspects of the Lakes. Barry&#39;s other published books include: Ships of the Great Lakes: Georgian Bay, The Sixth Great Lake; The Fate of the Lakes; The Battle of Lake Erie; The Great Lakes and Georgian Bay an Illustrated History. Barry&#39;s newest title, Old Forts of the Great Lakes: Sentinels in the Wilderness, continues the tradition of comprehensively researched and dramatically presented titles about the Great Lakes and their history.</p><h2>The Antiquities of Athens: Measured and Delineated by James Stuart FRS and FSA and Nicholas Revett, Painters and Architects</h2><p>James "Athenian" Stuart and Nicholas Revett's monumental <em>Antiquities of Athens</em> was the first accurate survey of ancient Greek architecture ever completed.

The vastly popular Web site, now a book, recognizes "individuals who ensure the long-term survival of our species by removing themselves from the gene pool in a sublimely idiotic fashion." Who wins a Darwin Award? Terrorists who set their bombs on daylight saving time and delivered them on standard time, blowing themselves up. Folks who put garlands around a Bengal tiger's neck. Guys in Cambodia who took turns stomping on a land mine they'd brought into a bar. The six Egyptians who drowned trying to rescue a chicken that fell into a well. (The chicken alone survived.) The Buenos Aires husband who threw his wife out an eighth-floor window during a spat, noticed she'd gotten caught in power lines, and jumped after her, "angrily trying to finish the job, or remorsefully hoping to rescue her." He went splat; she escaped unscathed. There are some urban legends, like the sergeant said to have attached a Jet-Assisted Take-Off unit to his Chevy and hit a cliff 125 feet up (not true, says author Wendy Northcutt), and all-too-true honorable mentions, like the man who put weather balloons on his lawn chair, soared to 16,000 feet, crashed into power lines, blacked out Long Beach, California, and told police, "A man can't just sit around." My favorite winner: the man who was bitten nine times by the same king brown snake because he put it in a bag on his car seat and kept sticking his hand back into the bag. Why did he pick up the snake with his left hand? "Because I was holding a beer in my right one." And where did this take place? In Darwin, Australia.

She nags them to pack their bags, to get ready on time, and to not forget their sneakers. She feels bad for nagging them, and all of it takes me back to when Daughter Francesca was ten years old and we had one of the best fights of our life.<br>And yes, you can have a good fight with your daughter.<br>If you&#x2019;ve read me before, you know that I think fighting is healthy and normal, and a good fight is when you learn something from your kid. Not when you win.<br>If you win, ten years later, your daughter will turn up pregnant.<br>Don&#x2019;t try to win. Try to learn.<br>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.<br>I&#x2019;ll never forget the day of our fight, because it&#x2019;s when I started traveling light.<br>Now I have it all figured out, especially with respect to nagging. We either do what our mothers did, or we do the exact opposite.<br>And hopefully, this is a conscious choice, since in due time, if we have any self-awareness at all, we catch on and live the examined life. We figure out our own way to parent, and even to live. We don&#x2019;t have to become our mothers unless we want to.<br>We have free will, and better shoes.<br>Most of the time, I want to become Mother Mary. I parent the same way Mother Mary did, in many ways, mainly in loving my kid more than words can say and saying so, complete with hugging, kissing, praising, and celebrating in general.<br>Mother Mary thinks it&#x2019;s cute when I fart, and that&#x2019;s what we call unconditional love.<br>Love is such a positive emotion, and kids need to hear it all the time, even grown-up kids. It makes everybody happier, like a hearty plate of spaghetti.<br>I&#x2019;m Italian, remember?<br>But one thing that Mother Mary did not do is nag.<br>And there&#x2019;s a reason for that.<br>Let me remind you that Mother Mary grew up as the youngest of nineteen children. This is not a joke. Well, at least, I&#x2019;m not kidding.<br>The Flying Scottolines were excellent Catholics, way back when.<br>Her mother, my grandmother, was married twice because her first husband died, probably from the exertion.<br>Even Italians have limits.<br>Anyway, I grew up with Mother Mary telling me stories from her childhood, all of which rival <i>Angela&#x2019;s Ashes</i> for their cheeriness. There were siblings who died in infancy. The family was so poor they ate her pet rabbit. There was no money to send anybody to college, and though my mother did well in school, her mother wanted her to drop out and get a job.<br>Nobody puts Mother Mary in a corner.<br>She defied her mother, worked while she went to high school, and graduated at the top of her class.<br>God bless her.<br>But even her funnier stories from her childhood make it sound like she was raised by wolves. Half the time, her parents didn&#x2019;t know she was around. Once she got pneumonia, and nobody noticed. No one helped her with her homework, got her to a dentist or doctor, or made sure that she had books or clothes, much less that she was dressed and ready for anything on time. In fact, she walked half the city to go to her high school, through some very rough neighborhoods, all by herself.<br>Needless to say, nobody nagged Mother Mary.<br>So when she raised me, she didn&#x2019;t know she was supposed to nag me. She didn&#x2019;t get the memo.<br>She made a decision to be more loving than her mother, and love came naturally to her. But although she loved us, and was there when she needed us, she just wasn&#x2019;t in our business. She always worked as a secretary, and we let ourselves in after school and were generally responsible for ourselves.<br>Not that I&#x2019;m complaining. Brother Frank and I had a great childhood. We grew up happy, healthy, and pretty much in charge of our own fates. And when we got burned, we felt the consequences.<br>So we never did it again.<br>For example, Brother Frank started to ditch English classes in high school, and my parents didn&#x2019;t catch on until a notice came home saying he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to graduate.<br>Opera ensued.<br>My parents went hysterically to the school, which agreed to let him graduate if he went to summer school to make up the classes, but also required him to walk at the end of the processional line at graduation.<br>This was worse than it sounds.<br>The processional line was in order of height, and the guy at the end of the line was so tall he went on to play for the NBA.<br>Brother Frank was five feet, six inches.<br>At graduation, he looked like a sheepish caboose, or a punctuation mark at the end of capital letters, LIKE THIS.<br>And everybody laughed, eventually even Frank.<br>Fast forward to when I become a mother, with a daughter, and in the meantime, the world has changed. Walking at the end of the procession isn&#x2019;t the worst that can happen anymore. There&#x2019;s meth addiction, psycho killers, and reality television.<br>So you know where this is going.<br>I started nagging.<br>When Francesca was little, I nagged her to do her homework, take a bath, clean her room, and wear a heavier coat, and she always told me to stop nagging. Then one day, I remember the morning, she was in fifth grade, and I was rushing her out the door, nagging that we&#x2019;d be late to school, and she simply burst into tears.<br>She said, &#x201c;Mom, you&#x2019;re ignoring me. I&#x2019;m asking you not to nag me, and you&#x2019;re ignoring what I say.&#x201d;<br>And I looked at my child, whom I had made cry, her round blue eyes brimming with tears. And finally, I heard her. I realized she was right. She has never been late for anything. She was even born on her due date.<br>I was nagging her because I needed to nag her, not because she needed to be nagged.<br>And that&#x2019;s why they call it emotional baggage.<br>I&#x2019;m learning to check it, in all senses of the word.<br>Because I still carry it around, whether it&#x2019;s the way I parent or the way I deal with my daughter, my friends, men, the people I work with, and even my dogs.<br>Dogs don&#x2019;t have emotional baggage.<br>And if they did, they&#x2019;d forget it at the airport.<br>They know they don&#x2019;t need it.<br>So I look for when it gets in the way of my relationships, especially mine to Francesca, as she grows older. We are best friends, but we&#x2019;re still smoothing out the wrinkles between us. It&#x2019;s a lifelong process, because we both keep growing, and those wrinkles have made for some of the best, worst, saddest, and funniest moments of my life.<br>This is a book that chronicles those moments. It&#x2019;s about our lives, my daughter&#x2019;s and mine, living both together and apart, as we both grow older. Precious few books are devoted to a mother&#x2019;s relationship with her adult child, which is crazy, because these bonds become more important, not less, as time goes on.<br>Family is forever.<br>So read on.<br>I bet that these stories will resonate with you, because you&#x2019;ve had moments like these, too. The only difference between us is that Francesca and I wrote them down.<br>And, as you may have guessed, I haven&#x2019;t stopped nagging, not completely, especially not since she moved to New York, where the meth addicts and psycho killers form a processional of their own.<br>Just kidding.<br>Though you&#x2019;ll read in the following pages about Francesca&#x2019;s adventures in the big city, complete with her own personal flasher.<br>The truth is, sometimes nagging is required, and sometimes it isn&#x2019;t, and the most anybody can ask of a mother is that we pause, examine what we&#x2019;re doing and why, then nag if it&#x2019;s in order. Then it&#x2019;s a conscious choice, and we reserve the right to nag.<br>Because we&#x2019;ve lived longer, and we know more. Even if you&#x2019;re an adult child, we&#x2019;re still more adult.<br>And you have to listen to us. Not because we&#x2019;re your mothers, but because we listen to you.<br>And that&#x2019;s love.<br>Forever.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Smart Blonde, LLC, and Francesca Scottoline Serritella<br></p><h2>Sacred Hunt: A Portrait of the Relationship Between Seals and Inuit</h2><p>Drawing upon six years of field research, including many conversations with Inuit people, independent scholar Pelly presents a history of seal hunting in the Arctic.

During his childhood, Richard lived the nightmare and horrors we only hear of - known as child abuse. From his earliest memories, Richard recalls watching his older brother David being abused and was the only witnesses to his mother&#39;s attempt to kill her son and Richard&#39;s older brother. Once the California authorities learned of the unspeakable acts occurring in a suburban California home, the state removed Richard&#39;s brother leaving him and three other boys behind. Throughout his adolescence and teen years, Richard suffered physical, mental and emotional abuse at the hands of his mother. Richard spent most of his teenage years moving about the country from Maui, Hawaii to Richmond, Virginia seeking the support and love of a family. Richard barely survived his incredible abusive childhood and his own self-destructive teenage years. After thirty years and with the support of his wife, Richard collected his memoirs and created his first book &#34;A BROTHER&#39;S JOURNEY&#34;. This collection of memoirs tells of the emotions and heartache that a child abuse victim carries throughout those tender and short years from ages 5 to 15. &#34;A BROTHER&#39;S JOURNEY is due for release in January 2005. His second book, &#34;FROM PREDATOR TO PREY a teenager&#39;s journey&#34; takes a hard look at a young man struggling to find himself. A very honest and straightforward look at the challenges facing teen&#39;s that grow up as abused children, &#34;FROM PREDATOR TO PREY&#34; provides a unique insight for anyone who has ever been or will ever be a teenager. The experience and honesty in this work is carefully woven into a life story of challenges, failures and accomplishments of a teenager desperate to find closure and leave his childhood behind him. Until recently he was employed in the banking and financial fields. Richard lives on the South Shore of Massachusetts where he now spends his time as a writer. Currently Richard is finishing his third memoir &#34;CLOSER a man&#39;s journey&#34; which tells of the heartbreak and embarrassment found in the pages of his memoirs of years past and the lessons learned. &#34;CLOSER&#34; is a satisfying close to the journeys of a young, red head freckled faced child who eventually made it through and survived a life that few adults could even fathom. By the end of the series, the reader learns that grown men cry and often secretly desire to revert back to the innocence of childhood - at any age and that anything can be overcome if there is a reason to. RICHARD B. PELZER is the younger brother of Dave Pelzer, the bestselling author of Help Yourself and the acclaimed trilogy of personal memoirs, A Child Called &#34;It,&#34; The Lost Child, and A Man Called Dave. Richard lives outside of Boston, Massachusetts, with his wife and four children.Although not meant to be a horror story, the chilling descriptions of the author's childhood abuse by his mother could be mistaken for those of a Stephen King novel. The woman beat the children, stabbed them with a kitchen knife, made them eat their vomit from the floor, and called the youngest son, David, "It." Joshua Gates's mean tone for the drunken woman's tirades jumps out like a monster from the dark. However, he mollifies the disgusting acts with a soft voice that makes hearing about them tolerable. These clever inflectional changes allow listeners to both hate the mother and suffer for the children. The taciturn pitch used for the abused boy's thoughts sounds dominated and terrified. A maturation of the boy's character at the denouement scores a partial victory for good. J.A.H.

Included are the voices of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Ram Dass, Thich Nhat Hanh, Arun and Sunanda Gandhi and others. Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergy are represented as well as Native American, Confucian and Buddhist perspectives, creating a truly multi-faith resource. Woven with a customized musical score of great beauty, it creates a compelling invitation for the listener to consider the eternal questions of life. What Graceful Passages is for: Provides relaxation, fresh insight and a renewal of faith for anyone exploring issues of life and death. Assists dying persons, their families and caregivers to shift from denial to acceptance Addresses such themes as letting go, closure, expressing love, forgiveness, appreciation of life, and</p><p>Each year half of America will be touched by the death of a friend or loved one. Bill Moyers, whose landmark PBS series on dying aired in September of 2000 (which listed Graceful Passages as a primary musical resource) writes, "Surveys show that Americans- including baby boomers (estimated at nearly 80 million people in their late forties and fifties) who are becoming aware of their own mortality while caring for their elderly parents- are exploring issues of death and dying with new openness. Awareness is growing that we can and must improve care at the end of life." Feature articles in Time, The Wall Street Journal and other mainstream media show growing attention to this issue. <p>The wonder of life is often overlooked. The preciousness of being alive, of appreciating ourselves, each other, and our world, is sometimes the last thing we remember in our rush. </p><p>Despite advances in medical science, we are neither capable of preventing our transition from this world nor in control of the timing. As reluctant as we may be to approach the subject, admitting our mortality is an important step toward embracing life on its own terms. Such an acceptance can profoundly support a recognition of the moment-by-moment gift of life itself. </p><p>At any stage of life, suffering is increased by denial and resistance. This applies equally to those at the beginning, middle, or end of life. There is a need for effective, artful ways to ease the shift from resistance to acceptance, to address anyone who is going through or anticipating loss. </p><p>Our response has been Graceful Passages, A Companion for Living and Dying, a 2-CD giftbook of spoken voices and music addressing this issue. We have recorded people, among whom are foremost experts in the field of loss and transition, speaking candidly on the key elements common to the dying process, themes which are relevant at any stage of life. </p><p>These themes include: the process of letting go, elements of closure. giving and receiving love, forgiveness , appreciation of life, and continuity of spirit. </p><p>The people we have selected as speakers, coming from different traditions, share an extraordinary quality of presence which infuses their words with a tender, universal eloquence. The messages they deliver are spoken in an atmosphere of peaceful honoring. </p><p>To further enhance the delivery of these messages of acceptance, we have created music to support the psycho-spiritual transition observed in dying persons, created with the intention of gently addressing persons behind the resistance of their conscious defenses. This music is intended to provide an opportunity for all listeners to both relax and to feel supported in freely expressing feelings with or without words, thus more easily experiencing reconciliation, resolution and peaceful transitions, wherever they may be on the continuum of life. </p><p>Our sincere appreciation to the Nathan Cummings Foundation, Fund For Global Awakening, and all who have contributed financially to this endeavor. We tithe 10% of this product to hospice and numerous organizations.</p>Bringing forth Graceful Passages has been a continuous process of letting go, of opening to the immensity, uniqueness and simplicity that each dying represents. The pace of surrender has been relentless, including the frequent transformation or termination of concepts, assumptions and deadlines. <p>I have been greatly moved by the wise beings encountered throughout this project. It was a special blessing to record all the speakers, more than we were able to include in this volume. Working with Gary&#x2019;s artistry and dedication has been a true gift, as has been the extraordinary outpouring of goodwill from everyone we met along the way. Originally intended as a resource to support those exiting from this earth life, Graceful Passages has turned out to be an inspirational portal for reverently and courageously embracing this world. &#x2013;Michael Stillwater </p><p>I had the honor to be with my father during his last weeks on Earth. His farewells were made with such loving presence and dignity that my perceptions of death were forever changed. </p><p>So when my friend Michael Stillwater called, I was ready for what he proposed. His own father had recently died, and the passage had inspired a vision of using music to heal people&#x2019;s hearts touched by the mystery of death. Compelled by the memory of my father&#x2019;s final days, I embraced the dream wholeheartedly. </p><p>Graceful Passages is an offering to all who wish to be deeply met at this doorway. I feel privileged to have worked with Michael and with such magnificent speakers and musicians to create a work more moving than I could have envisioned. Wherever you are on this journey, my hope is that Graceful Passages will inspire gratitude for the precious gift of life. -Gary Remal Malkin</p></p><h2>Geographica: The Complete Illustrated Atlas of the World</h2><p>Used.

VITUS&#39; DANCE, lives in Haddam, Connecticut.Grade 3-6. When his sculptor father is bitten by a cobra, Senmut believes that if he can carve a statue of the healer-goddess Sekhmet that will please her, she will help save Yuf. But as the boy works, he carelessly throws aside a tool, accidentally killing a dove. This thoughtless act, in the ancient Egypt Rubalcaba has re-created, means a death sentence for Senmut, unless the gods intercede on his behalf. They do, and instead of a quick death, the boy is sentenced to work in the mines, which will lead, he knows, to a slower, but no-less-sure, demise. How the protagonist escapes this fate and, by virtue of his talent and some good luck, survives to become Royal Sculptor to the Pharaoh, makes for an exciting and information-filled adventure. The details of daily life, customs, and beliefs of the people are wonderfully revealed through the words and deeds of the characters. The story has enough excitement to capture the interest of most reluctant readers. While several of the events rely on coincidence, careful plotting and foreshadowing prepare readers for some of the ensuing action. The prologue, for example, is told from the cobra's perspective and cleverly sets the stage for what follows. The places and objects are so well described that they can be easily visualized by children unfamiliar with Egyptian artifacts. A substantial glossary helps to identify and explain unfamiliar terms. A fine story for enjoyment or as curriculum support for units on ancient Egypt.?Linda Greengrass, Bank Street College Library, New York City<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eyes Right!: Challenging the Right Wing Backlash</h2><p>The urgent essays in <i>Eyes Right!</i> show how to counter right-wing corporate, religious and political agendas, and defend democracy and diversity.

There were snowdrops and primroses and even a few crocuses in the woods and along the hedgerows beside the road, and there were a few shoots of green in otherwise bare gardens. There was a suggestion of green about the branches of trees, though one had to look closely to observe the delicate buds. The air was warmer than it had been and the sun seemed a little brighter. The roads and laneways had dried after the last heavy cover of snow.</p><p>Yes, spring was coming. But the surest sign of all, and the one most welcome to many of the inhabitants of the small village of Bodley-on-the-Water, was that the family was returning to the house. Almost invariably they left soon after Christmas, sometimes before, and spent the winter months visiting various friends.</p><p>Their absence was a trial to many of the villagers, for whom winter would have been dreary enough anyway. But for those two months they were forced to live without a sight of Mrs. Adams driving through the village, often nodding regally through the window at a fortunate passerby, or of the same Mrs. Adams, a vision of fashionable elegance, entering church and sweeping down the aisle, looking neither to left nor to right, to sit in the padded front pew. The poor and sick and elderly had to live without her personal conveyance of their food baskets&#x2014;though a footman always carried them from the carriage to the house&#x2014;and her gracious condescension in inquiring after their health. Those of some social stature had to live without the occasional flattering visit, during which Mrs. Adams would sit inside her carriage, the window down, while the favored recipient of her attention was summoned from the house by a liveried footman in order to stand on the path curtsying or bowing to her and asking how Master William and Miss Juliana did.</p><p>Even the children were rarely seen during the winter months, though they were not often taken visiting with their mama and papa. Their nurse was firmly of the belief that winter air was bad for children.</p><p>This year Mr. and Mrs. Adams had stayed for the past month at Stratton Park in Kent with no less a personage than Viscount Rawleigh. He was Mr. Adams&#x2019;s elder brother, as everyone knew. The fact was equally well-known that his lordship was Mr. Adams&#x2019;s senior by twenty minutes, a singular stroke of good fortune for him since he was now in possession of the title while the younger twin was not. They might have had a viscount and viscountess living at Bodley, some of them often said wistfully during sessions of gossip, if the situation had been reversed. But then perhaps the maternal grandmother would have left the property to the <i>other</i> brother and they would still have had a mere mister living there.</p><p>Not that they minded the fact that the family had no title. They had all the other trappings of gentility, and any stranger was soon apprised of the fact that the owner of Bodley was an <i>Honorable</i> and the brother of Viscount Rawleigh of Stratton.</p><p>The Honorable Mr. Adams and his wife were returning home within the week. One of the footmen at Bodley brought word to the village inn, where he drank his ale nightly, and from the inn the word was spread through the village. They were bringing houseguests with them, the head groom told the blacksmith, and speculation became rife.</p><p><i>Was Viscount Rawleigh to be one of the guests?</i></p><p>Viscount Rawleigh was to be one of the houseguests. Mrs. Croft, the housekeeper at Bodley, brought the news to Mrs. Lovering, the rector&#x2019;s wife. And there were to be several other ladies and gentlemen too as guests. She really had no idea if there were any other titles among them. She would not have known about his lordship except that Mrs. Adams&#x2019;s letter had referred to her brother-in-law, and Mr. Adams had no other brother except the viscount, did he? But one could be certain that any company that included Viscount Rawleigh must be distinguished company.</p><p>It was almost worth having been without the family for two dreary months, it was generally agreed. Two years had passed since Mr. and Mrs. Adams had brought home guests with them and it was many years since Viscount Rawleigh had visited his brother in the country.</p><p>Anticipation ran high in the village. No one knew the exact hour or day of the arrival, but everyone was on the alert. There was bound to be more than one carriage for the family and visitors and a whole fleet of carriages to bring their belongings and their servants. It was a sight not to be missed. Fortunately there was no way for them to come from Kent except through the village. One just had to hope that they would not arrive after dark. But surely they would not when there were lady travelers and one never knew when highwaymen would be lurking on darkened roads.</p><p>Spring was coming at last and with it new life and vigor and splendor&#x2014;splendor in the woods and hedgerows and splendor of another, even more exciting kind at Bodley.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>DESPITE herself, Mrs. Catherine Winters, widow, found that she glanced far more often than she normally did through the front windows of her little thatched cottage at the southern end of the village street, and that she listened with heightened senses for the sound of approaching carriages. She loved her back garden more than the front because of the fruit trees with their branches hanging over the lawn and the shade they offered in the summer and because the river flowed and gurgled over mossy stones at the end of the garden. But she found herself more often than not in the front garden these days, watching the crocuses come into bud and a few brave shoots of the daffodil bulbs push through the soil. Though she would have scurried indoors fast enough if she really had heard carriages coming. She did so one morning only to find that it was the Reverend Ebenezer Lovering returning in his one-horse cart from a visit to a nearby farm.</p><p>She had mixed feelings about the return of the family to Bodley. The children would be happy. They had been longing for weeks for the return of their mama. She would come laden with gifts when she did come, of course, and spoil them for weeks, so that their classes would be disrupted. But then, children needed their mother more than they did lessons of any description. Catherine gave them music lessons at the house twice a week, though neither child had a great deal of aptitude on the pianoforte. Of course, they were young. Juliana was only eight years old, William seven.</p><p>Life was marginally more interesting when Mr. Adams and his wife were at home. Occasionally Catherine was invited to the house for dinner or for a card party. She was aware of the fact that it happened only when Mrs. Adams needed to even numbers and was one female short. And she was very aware of the condescension with which she was treated on such occasions. Even so, there was something treacherously pleasant about the opportunity to dress her best&#x2014;though her self-made clothes must be woefully unfashionable by town standards, she was sure&#x2014;and to be in company with people who had some conversation.</p><p>And Mr. Adams himself was always amiable and courteous. He was an extremely handsome gentleman and had passed on his looks to his children, though Mrs. Adams was rather lovely too. But Catherine had learned to avoid his company at the house. Mrs. Adams&#x2019;s tongue could become decidedly barbed if the two of them fell into conversation together. Foolish woman&#x2014;as if Catherine&#x2019;s behavior had ever indicated that she was interested in dalliance of any kind.</p><p>She was not. She was finished with men. And with love. And with flirtation. They had brought her to where she was now. Not that she was complaining. She had a pleasant enough home in a pleasant enough village and she had learned how to occupy her time usefully so that the days were not unbearably tedious.</p><p>She was glad that the family was returning&#x2014;<i>partly</i> glad. But they were bringing houseguests with them&#x2014;plural. Viscount Rawleigh she did not know. She had never met him and never heard of him before she came to live at Bodley-on-the-Water. But there were to be other guests, doubtless people of <i>ton.</i> And there was the chance that she might know one or more of them&#x2014;or, more to the point, that at least one of them would know her.</p><p>It was a remote chance, but it filled her with unease.</p><p>She did not want the peace of her life disturbed. It had been too hard won.</p><p>They came in the middle of one brisk but sunny afternoon when she was standing at the end of her front path, bidding farewell to Miss Agatha Downes, spinster daughter of a former rector, who had called on her and taken tea with her. It was quite impossible to scurry back inside so that she might cower behind the parlor curtain and observe while remaining unobserved. All she could do was stand there, without even a bonnet to shield her face, and wait to be recognized. She envied Toby, her terrier, who was safe inside the house, barking noisily.</p><p>There were three carriages, if one discounted the baggage coaches, which were some distance behind. It was impossible to see who rode in them, though Mrs. Adams leaned forward in her seat in the first of them in order to raise one hand and incline her head to them. Rather like a queen acknowledging her peasant subjects, Catherine thought with the humor that carried her through all her encounters with Mrs. Adams. She nodded her head in reply to the greeting.</p><p>There were three gentlemen on horseback. A quick glance assured Catherine that two of them were strangers. And the third was no threat either. She had smiled at Mr. Adams and curtsied to him&#x2014;something she always avoided doing whenever she could with his wife&#x2014;before something in his bearing and in the cool, unsmiling, arrogant way he looked back at her alerted her to the fact that he was not Mr. Adams at all.</p><p>Of course, Mr. Adams had a twin&#x2014;Viscount Rawleigh. How humiliating! She could feel the color rising hotly to her cheeks and hoped that he had ridden on far enough not to have noticed. She also hoped it would seem that her curtsy had been in general acknowledgment of the whole group.</p><p>&#x201c;My dear Mrs. Winters,&#x201d; Miss Downes was saying, &#x201c;how gratifying it is that we happened to be outside and so close to the road when Mr. Adams and his dear wife and their distinguished guests returned home. It was most agreeable of Mrs. Adams to nod to us, I am sure. She might have stayed back in the shadows, as I am certain she was inclined to do after the tedium of a long journey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Catherine agreed, &#x201c;traveling is indeed a tiresome business, Miss Downes. I am sure they will all be thankful to be at Bodley House in time for tea.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Downes stepped out through the gateway and turned in the direction of home, eager to share what she had just seen with her aged invalid mother. Catherine looked after her down the street and saw in some amusement that everyone seemed to be out of doors. It was as if a great procession had just gone past and everyone was still basking in the glory of having seen it.</p><p>She was still feeling mortified. Perhaps Viscount Rawleigh would have realized the mistake she had made in singling him out for her curtsy&#x2014;and her smile. Perhaps, she thought hopefully, other people in the village had done the same thing. Perhaps some of them did not realize even yet the mistake they had made.</p><p>His looks were almost identical to Mr. Adams&#x2019;s, she thought. But if first impressions were anything to judge by&#x2014;and she judged by them even though she realized that she was perhaps being unfair&#x2014;he was quite different in character. This man was haughty and lacking in humor. There had been a coldness in his dark eyes. Perhaps it was a difference that twenty fateful minutes had wrought. Lord Rawleigh had all the consequence of a title and a large fortune and a rich and vast property to live up to.</p><p>She hoped she would not have the embarrassment of meeting him again. She hoped that his stay at Bodley would be of short duration, though it was altogether probable that he had not even noticed her more particularly than anyone else in his regal progress along the street.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>&#x201c;WELL,&#x201d; Eden Wendell, Baron Pelham, said as they progressed along the single street of Bodley-on-the-Water, feeling rather as if they were part of a circus parade, &#x201c;at least we were wrong about one thing.&#x201d;</p><p>His two friends did not ask him what that one thing was since they had talked specifically about it before deciding to rusticate for a while in Derbyshire and during their journey there.</p><p>&#x201c;But only one among the three of us,&#x201d; Mr. Nathaniel Gascoigne said with mock gloom, &#x201c;unless there are a few dozen others hiding behind the curtains of these cottage windows.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ever the dreamer, Nat,&#x201d; Rex Adams, Viscount Rawleigh, said. &#x201c;At a guess I would say that every villager and his dog is out on the street to gawk at us going by. And by my observations there has been only one looker among them.&#x201d;</p><p>Lord Pelham sighed. &#x201c;And she had eyes for no one but you, Rex, damn your eyes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My blue eyes have been called irresistible by more than one lady of my acquaintance, but the village looker did not even glance into them. All she saw was you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It might have been as well if one lady had not found your eyes so irresistible, Eden,&#x201d; Lord Rawleigh said dryly. &#x201c;If I had been in town, perhaps she would have looked into mine instead and you would not have been forced to rusticate for a few months, including the whole of the Season.&#x201d;</p><p>Lord Pelham winced while Mr. Gascoigne threw back his head and laughed. &#x201c;A hit, Ede,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come, you must admit it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was new to town,&#x201d; Lord Pelham said, scowling, &#x201c;and had a body to die for. How was I to know that she was married? You two may find the idea of being discovered in bed by a husband and in the act, so to speak, to be uproariously hilarious, but I did not and do not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In truth,&#x201d; Mr. Gascoigne said, one hand to his heart, &#x201c;I feel for you, Ede. The timing was wretched. He might at least have had the decency to wait in the shadows until you were properly&#x2014;or improperly&#x2014;finished.&#x201d; He threw back his head and laughed again.

From its astonishing, sensual opening sentence (``The pear was plump, ripe, juicy, palm jade''), this is the story of the education of Kirstein's aesthetic sensibility and its fulfillment in his most lasting achievement, the founding of the New York City Ballet. Despite its revealing tone, it is not intimate (due partly to sometimes stuffy prose), yet it is almost always engaging. This self-portrait shows the young Kirstein to be by turns charming and expansive, self-deprecating and confused as he learns that, contrary to his hopes, he is not destined to be an artist. Kirstein is the son of German Jews who penetrated the upper reaches of Boston society. Gifted with what he calls ``nervous energy'' and a wealthy, supportive papa, the self-described hedonist pursues his artistic and amorous fancies from Harvard to Paris to New York City. The strange highlights of Kirstein's life shine through: An encounter with the mystic Gurdjieff is at once chilling and comic; pursuing the low life, Kirstein conceives an unrequited love for a gritty sailor. The chapters dealing with Kirstein's precocious founding of Hound &amp; Horn and the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art are oddly devoid of passion; but the grand spectacle of his life, narrated in this volume's last chapter, begins in 1933. In Paris, where he seeks out the ballet, the intrigues and jealousies of artists, dancers, and stage mothers are topped only by the supreme wiles of Romola Nijinsky, in whose service Kirstein finds himself. Kirstein, now an impresario-in-training, courts George Balanchine, hoping he will found a ballet school and company--in Hartford, Connecticut. Of course, a Balanchine-led Hartford Ballet was not to be. One hopes that Kirstein's elliptical ending is the promise of another volume to complete his colorful mosaic. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kirstein ( Movement and Metaphor ), a pivotal figure in the arts best known as a founder of the New York City Ballet and its associated school, also established and edited a literary quarterly, the Hound &amp; Horn , organized the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art (which later evolved into the Museum of Modern Art) and has contributed richly to American culture as a critic and historian of dance and visual art, as a poet and as a collector. His memoirs give a resiliently irascible intelligence a fresh opportunity to play and work. The memoirs cover a span beginning in Kirstein's childhood (he was born in 1907) and leading up to 1933, when he sought out George Balanchine in Europe to help assemble the beginnings of the NYCB. Kirstein's reflections are personal, insightfully assessing people encountered in his youth (e.g., the critic R. P. Blackmur at Harvard) and during travels abroad; aesthetic (his "strident 'modernism' " took early root); and philosophical. Part of Kirstein's fascination is his eccentricity: though aided with a family fortune (his father was a partner in Filene's department store in Boston), his aggrandizing, energetic vision seems singularly entrepreneurial; though he is known as a stern advocate of the virtues of classicism, his pugnacity seems as likely to challenge or to oppose as it does to submit or assimilate. Kirstein's caustic urbanity and questioning wit are critical and companionable by turns in this selective survey of his past. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wild Animals I Have Known (annotated)</h2><p>The first entry in a new genre of realistic wild-animal fiction, Wild Animals I Have Known, Seton's first collection of short stories quickly became one of the most popular books of its day. "Lobo the King of Currumpaw", the first story in the collection, was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the southwestern United States. It became a classic, setting the tone for his future works that would similarly depict animals&#x2014;especially predators who were often demonized in literature&#x2014;as compassionate, individualistic beings.Several years after its publication, Seton and his works came under fire during the nature fakers controversy, which began in 1903 when naturalist John Burroughs published an essay called "Real and Sham Natural History" in The Atlantic Monthly. In particular Burroughs blamed Seton's collection of stories for founding the sentimental animal story genre, which he felt featured fabricated events and wild animal behaviors; he even amended the title of the collection to Wild Animals I Alone Have Known. In This Book: Lobo, the King of Currumpaw Silverspot, the Story of a Crow Raggylug, the Story of a Cottontail Rabbit Bingo, the Story of My Dog The Springfield Fox The Pacing Mustang Wully, the Story of a Yaller Dog Redruff, the Story of the Don Valley Partridge THESE STORIES are true. Although I have left the strict line of historical truth in many places, the animals in this book were all real characters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp of heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the power of my pen to tell.Ernest Thompson Seton (born Ernest Evan Thompson[1] August 14, 1860 &#x2013; died October 23, 1946) was an author (published in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US), wildlife artist, founder of the Woodcraft Indians in 1902 (renamed Woodcraft League of America) and one of the founding pioneers of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1910. Seton also influenced Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting. His notable books related to Scouting include The Birch Bark Roll and the Boy Scout Handbook. He is responsible for the appropriation and incorporation of what he believed to be American Indian elements into the traditions of the BSA.Seton was born in South Shields, County Durham (now part of South Tyneside, Tyne and Wear), England of Scottish parents. His family emigrated to Canada in 1866. Most of his childhood was spent in Toronto, Ontario and known to have lived at 6 Aberdeen Avenue in Cabbagetown. As a youth, he retreated to the woods of the Don River to draw and study animals as a way of avoiding his abusive father. He won a scholarship in art to the Royal Academy in London, England.[2]On his twenty-first birthday, Seton's father presented him with an invoice for all the expenses connected with his childhood and youth, including the fee charged by the doctor who delivered him. He paid the bill, but never spoke to his father again.He changed his name to Ernest Thompson Seton, believing that Seton had been an important family name. He became successful as a writer, artist and naturalist, and moved to New York City to further his career. Seton later lived at Wyndygoul, an estate that he built in Cos Cob, a section of Greenwich, Connecticut. After experiencing vandalism by the local youth, Seton invited them to his estate for a weekend where he told them what he claimed were stories of the American Indians and of nature.He formed the Woodcraft Indians in 1902 and invited the local youth to join. Despite the name, the group was made up of non-native boys and girls. The stories became a series of articles written for the Ladies Home Journal, and were eventually collected in The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians in 1906. Shortly after, the Woodcraft Indians evolved into the Woodcraft Rangers.</p><p>Ernest Thompson Seton (August 14, 1860 - October 23, 1946) was a British author, wildlife artist, founder of the Woodcraft Indians, and one of the founding pioneers of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).

She is a woman who is married to her husband and not to popular American culture. The politically incorrect wife does not buy into the stifling modern-day thinking that says, &#34;Look out for number one. Treat your husband no better than he treats you.&#34; Instead, she cultivates a joyful marriage using transformational spiritual principles. As formerly politically correct wives with miserable marriages, popular speakers and authors Nancy Cobb and Connie Grigsby lead readers confidently beyond the picket lines of the politically correct -- into a warm, rewarding marriage.</p><p><b>Connie Grigsby</b><br><br>Connie Grigsby, a University of Oklahoma graduate, enjoys pointing others towards life's bottom line. With warmth and humor, she exhorts others to refuse to be content with ho-hum living. Grigsby is a popular teacher and speaker involved in women's and youth ministries.<br><br><b>Nancy Cobb</b><br><br>Nancy Cobb is a popular speaker at women's retreats. She led a Bible study of over 500 women for four years in Raleigh, North Carolina, and has previously worked on the team of Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of Billy Graham, in teaching seminars to women at the Billy Graham Training Center. She is the Leader of Women's Ministries at Christ Community Church, a congregation of over 5,000, and spends much of her time mentoring younger women. She and her husband, Ray, have four grown children and live in Omaha, Nebraska.What Is a Politically <br>Incorrect Wife? <br> <br>You&#x2019;re probably wondering that right now, aren&#x2019;t you? The <br>politically incorrect wife is a woman who is married to <br>her husband&#x2014;and not married to popular American culture. <br>How she views her husband and how she treats him are not <br>determined by society&#x2019;s widely accepted ideologies. In fact, she <br>firmly refuses to bend to mind-sets that would ultimately damage <br>her marriage. It&#x2019;s not that she doesn&#x2019;t hold herself to a set of standards; <br>she does. But her standards are different&#x2014;higher, actually&#x2014; <br>than standards considered politically correct because they do not <br>offend people who hold to commonly agreed-upon thought. <br> <br>The politically incorrect wife does not buy into modern-day <br>thinking that says: <br> <br>1. You are in control of your own life. <br>2. Marriage is a fifty-fifty proposition. <br>3. You should treat your husband like he treats you. <br>4. Your feelings are your guide. <br>5. Your husband needs to earn your respect. <br>6. You should make him pay for your forgiveness. <br>7. There&#x2019;s no such thing as a happy marriage anymore. <br>8. Your husband&#x2019;s job is to make you happy. <br> <br>The politically incorrect wife does hold to these spiritual principles, <br>which transform from the inside out: <br> <br>1. Doing things God&#x2019;s way is the key to having a joyful life. <br>2. I am 100 percent responsible to God for my behavior as a wife. <br>3. I&#x2019;ll love my husband unconditionally. <br>4. I will act the way I want to feel. <br>5. Respecting my husband brings glory to God. <br>6. Forgiveness is a choice, not a feeling. <br>7. A Source of power is readily available to help me! <br>8. My joy is not determined by another human being. <br> <br>When it comes to both of these approaches to being a wife, you <br>can be confident that we (Nancy and Connie) speak with voices of <br>experience. Between the two of us, we bought into modern-day <br>thinking regarding marriage for nearly forty years! During that very <br>long and arduous time, we flowed right along with emerging cultural <br>values and became more entrenched in the idea that our husbands <br>had to earn their way to our hearts. Over the years we <br>became stingier about how much love, affection, care, and concern <br>we doled out to our husbands. In our minds, it made perfect sense <br>for us to suspiciously measure the amount of love we thought our <br>husbands were giving us and then treat them accordingly. <br> <br>Our modus operandi was faulty for a number of reasons. For <br>one thing, we were clueless to the fact that our measuring tools did <br>not take into account that a man&#x2019;s way of showing love to a woman <br>oftentimes does not directly correspond to how a woman perceives <br>love. Because we were using the wrong measuring tools, we didn&#x2019;t <br>realize that our husbands had been expressing their love to us all <br>along&#x2014;but from their male perspectives (imagine that!). <br> <br>And we held it against them! <br> <br>Of course, looking back now, it&#x2019;s easy to see just how selfish and <br>self-centered our idea of love really was. It&#x2019;s also easy to see how our <br>mind-sets were molded by society&#x2019;s present-day messages, which <br>basically say, &#x201c;I only do something for you if I can get something out <br>of it.&#x201d; <br> <br>Until we discovered God&#x2019;s plan for marriage and began to follow <br>His set of standards, our husbands felt like they couldn&#x2019;t win <br>no matter what they did. <br> <br>So they stopped trying. <br> <br>And so did we! <br> <br>Being politically correct kept our marriages in &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; position <br>for years&#x2014;so much so that if you had taken a snapshot of our marriages <br>during that time, you would have found cold hearts and <br>unhappy husbands who were resigned to living with emotionally <br>distant and often angry wives. <br> <br>By God&#x2019;s grace, we discovered a life-changing truth: Political <br>correctness doesn&#x2019;t work in a marriage. We were shocked to learn <br>this! After all, we had spent years shaping our lives around this <br>faulty view. Now, however, we consider that view to be utter foolishness <br>and thank God every day for showing us the spiritual principles <br>in His plan for marriage. <br> <br>SHARING THE FRUIT WITH YOU <br> <br>Not long after discovering God&#x2019;s scriptural &#x201c;job description&#x201d; for <br>wives, I (Nancy) realized that if I wanted to have a passionate rela- <br>tionship with Christ, I needed to do what He said. Since that&#x2019;s what <br>I wanted, I began being a wife God&#x2019;s way&#x2014;a wife empowered by <br>the very One who created marriage. This turned my world upside <br>down! Within weeks, God changed my heart of stone into a heart <br>of love for my husband, Ray. I now have the best of both worlds. I <br>love the Lord with all my heart and have never loved Ray more! <br> <br>For me (Connie), becoming politically incorrect in this area <br>changed not only my marriage, but my life as well. I developed a <br>genuine love for my husband, and I no longer treated him in an inkind <br>manner. This liberated him to love me in a fresh way. It softened <br>his heart toward me beyond description. Our daughters <br>comment on this regularly. Most of all, becoming a politically incorrect <br>wife opened the door to an intimate relationship with God. I <br>believe my treatment of Wes stood in the way of that for years. Why <br>would God shower His blessings on a stony heart? He didn&#x2019;t! <br>Before, I loved God in a casual sense. Now, I love Him with a passion. <br> <br>After we (Nancy and Connie) met and got to know each other, <br>we discovered that each of our lives had been radically transformed <br>when we began to follow God&#x2019;s ways in the area of marriage. We also <br>discovered that we have a similar passion for helping women <br>develop an intimate love relationship with Jesus and walk in the <br>freedom of having their primary ministry&#x2014;their marriage&#x2014;in <br>order. <br> <br>THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED <br> <br>So how did we come up with the concept of the politically incorrect <br>wife? Not long ago, we were talking with a woman who was <br>unhappy in her marriage. She wanted to know what she could do <br>to get her husband to change. After all, she mused, aren&#x2019;t husbands <br>the ones who need changing the most? <br> <br>We began to share our thoughts and ideas about what fulfills a <br>woman in marriage. And to her amazement, it had nothing to do <br>with changing her husband. <br> <br>She grew quiet and mulled over our words for quite some time. <br>Finally she announced, &#x201c;You know, the trouble with what you&#x2019;re <br>saying is that it&#x2019;s so politically incorrect to act that way.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly it is that,&#x201d; we agreed. &#x201c;But the real problem isn&#x2019;t that <br>it&#x2019;s politically incorrect. The problem is that political correctness <br>simply doesn&#x2019;t work in a marriage.&#x201d; <br> <br>We then challenged her to consider becoming a politically <br>incorrect wife. She said she just didn&#x2019;t know if she could do it <br>because her way made so much more sense to her. <br> <br>&#x201c;Tell us again how well your way is working,&#x201d; we responded, <br>with a bit of amusement in our voices. <br> <br>She burst into laughter! Obviously her way wasn&#x2019;t working at <br>all, for her answer began with the words, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so unhappy in my <br>marriage I could die.&#x201d; (To say it wasn&#x2019;t working was a huge understatement!) <br> <br>So the woman agreed to consider changing her course. We <br>seriously wondered if she&#x2019;d forsake the familiar for the unfamiliar. <br>However, she was so unhappy in her marriage that we thought she <br>might. <br> <br>Then, two weeks later, one of us received a call from her. <br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happier than I&#x2019;ve been <br>in years. We still have a long way to go, but I feel as if a huge weight <br>has been lifted from my shoulders. I feel like the five-hundredpound <br>gorilla is no longer sitting on my back. I feel like I&#x2019;m becoming <br>me again&#x2014;I&#x2019;d lost me for such a long time.&#x201d;</p><h2>Alaska-Open Mkt Ed</h2><p>The high points in the story of Alaska since the American acquisition are brought vividly to life through more than 100 characters, real and fictional.</p><p>In this sweeping epic of the northernmost American frontier, James A. Michener guides us across Alaska&#39;s fierce terrain, from the long-forgotten past to the bustling technological present, as his characters struggle for survival. The exciting high points of Alaska&#39;s story, from its brutal prehistory, through the nineteenth century and the American acquisition, to its modern status as America&#39;s thriving forty-ninth state, are brought vividly to life in this remarkable novel: the gold rush; the tremendous growth and exploitation of the salmon industry; the discovery of oil and its social and economic consequences; the difficult construction of the Alcan Highway, which made possible the defense of the territory in World War II. A spellbinding portrait of a human community struggling to establish its place in the world, Alaska traces a bold and majestic history of the enduring spirit of a land and its people.&#x201c;Mr. Michener is still, sentence for sentence, writing&#x2019;s fastest attention grabber.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Always the master of exhaustive historical research, Michener tracks the settling of Alaska [in] vividly detailed scenes and well-developed characters.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Boston Herald</i></p><h2>Astropilots (Omni, No 1)</h2><p>Andrea Ito, a top pilot at the space academy, is uncertain whether she should help Jason Stiletto, a fellow cadet, with his plan for revenge on the man who tried to kill him</p><p></p><h2>Horten's Incredible Illusions: Magic, Mystery &amp; Another Very Strange Adventure (Horten's Miraculous Mechanisms)</h2><p>This magical follow-up to <i>Horten's Miraculous Mechanisms</i> continues Stuart's amazing adventures--with more enchantment, more surprises, and more thrills. When we last left 10-year-old Stuart, he had just recovered his great-uncle Tony's long-lost magic workshop. Now all the priceless tricks are on display in the Beeton Museum--and Stuart is junior curator of the exhibit! But another mystery awaits Stuart:&nbsp;Where did the great magician hide his will? Only by entering the magic world of the workshop can he find the answer. But as the mechanisms whisk him off on increasingly incredible adventures, the puzzles become harder and harder to solve...and the stakes higher. With even more page-turning action, this second book in the exciting middle-grade series does a magic trick of its own: it's even better than the first!</p><p>Lissa Evans's route to children's fiction author is perhaps as roundabout as Stuart's adventures in Beeton. After a brief career as a doctor of medicine and then in stand-up comedy, Lissa became a comedy producer, first in radio and then in television, before turning to writing. Her first middle grade novel featuring young Stuart, <i>Horten's Miraculous Mechanisms</i>, was short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the Costa Book Awards, and UK Literacy Association's Children's Book Award.

Jan Morris reconstructs the whole of this glittering dominion in the form of a sea-voyage, travelling along the historic Venetian trade routes from Venice itself to Greece, Crete and Cyprus. It is a traveller&#39;s book, geographically arranged but wandering at will from the past to the present, evoking not only contemporary landscapes and sensations but also the characters, the emotions and the tumultuous events of the past. The first such work ever written about the Venetian &#39;Stato da Mar&#39;, it is an invaluable historical companion for visitors to Venice itself and for travellers through the lands the Doges once ruled.</p><p></p><h2>Elements of Faith: An Introduction to Orthodox Theology</h2><p>A clear and concise introduction to Orthodox theology.</p><p>Christos Yannaras is Professor of Philosophy at the Pantion University, Athens, Greece.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Magazines in 20th Century</h2><p>Second edition, revised, second printing.

She graduated from Wheaton College, where she studied French literature and fine arts. After working briefly with an advertising agency in New York, she moved to Boston and worked at a publishing company for ten years, first as a designer, then art editor, and finally as art director. While there, she did the illustrations for GOOD STONES (Houghton Mifflin) by Anne Epstein, and then decided to strike out on her own as a freelance illustrator and creator of children&#39;s books. Since that time, Susan has written and illustrated many popular books for children, including MARTHA SPEAKS, which was chosen as a NEW YORK TIMES Best Illustrated Book for 1992. In 1998 she was awarded the New England Book Award, given by the New England Booksellers Association to recognize a body of work. Her work also was acknowledged with a New York Times Best Illustrated Award. She lives in Sherborn, Massachusetts.Kindergarten-Grade 3?Meddaugh presents a hilarious story within a story as a piglet tells her family how she was caught by a wolf and nearly made into soup. Seeing that her captor is illiterate (he thinks E-Z Car Care is his granny's cookbook and "reads" upside down), she reads him a recipe that sends him on a wild wolf chase to a booby-trapped vegetable garden, to Torrential Waterfalls for fresh water, and to the forest for "Green Threeleaf" (poison ivy). Just as he prepares to light the fire, she chants a verse warning him that her "Hog-Eye" magic will make him itch everywhere, which of course he begins to do. She promises to release the spell if he lets her go, and thus makes her escape. Outside the main watercolor illustrations of the piglet's adventure, her family members comment on the action in dialogue balloons. Because of the dual story line; the marginal comments; and the numerous small, humorous details; this title will work better for small group or individual reading. Meddaugh's pigs, as well as her choice of villain, bear close resemblance to Mary Rayner's "Garth Pig" tales (Atheneum). Like Rayner's books, Hog-Eye will be heartily welcomed by children.?Susan Hepler, Alexandria City Public Schools, VA<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Michael Langford&#39;s 35mm Handbook</h2><p>Third Edition<br><br>Here, fully revised and updated to focus on the shift to fully automated cameras, is the best basic handbook of 35mm photography.

With John Wilkes Booth as its agent, the Confederate Secret Service devised a plan of retribution--to seize President Lincoln, hold him hostage, and bring the war-weary North to capitulation. The code word for this stratagem was "Come Retribution."</p><p>But when Booth was stymied, the Secret Service took another course. They conspired to bomb the White House during a conference of senior Union officials. But this plot also failed. Next, the Confederates devised for Confederate forces to abandon Richmond and Petersburg and to link up with General Joseph E. Johnston in the South before General Grant's forces were prepared to move. This plan was thwarted, however, when Grant took Richmond. By April 9, 1865, Lee was forced to surrender.</p><p>Yet the willful, ardent Booth, smarting from the South's loss of the war, took decisive action at Ford's Theater during that spring night in 1865.</p><p>Investigating the assassination from their perspective as career intelligence officers, William A. Tidwell and David Winfred Gaddy, joined by James O. Hall, one of the leading authorities on the assassination, find and follow the clues, interpret the clandestine evidence, and draw well-founded conclusions. They are the first to explore the Confederate Secret Service's link to the death of Lincoln. In <i>Come Retribution</i>, originally published in 1988 and now available again in a paperback edition, they offer startling insights and give a new direction to the well-known and often-told story of Lincoln and Booth.</p><p> "The facts presented and the inferences drawn are provocative," said Nathan Miller in <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. "Every account of the Lincoln assassination published in the future will have to take account of the arguments presented in this book."</p></p><p><p>An astonishing book that reveals the Confederacy?s role in the death of Lincoln</p>Was the assassination of Lincoln the result of a Confederate conspiracy? The authors (Tidwell and Gaddy are retired U.S. intelligence officers; Hall is a retired U.S. Department of Labor official) introduce sources that they say have never been consulted to reconstruct the covert operations of the Confederate Secret Service, including an elaborate plan to capture Lincoln in March 1865 that involved his eventual assassin John Wilkes Booth. Proposing that, contrary to the normative views of Civil War historians, the South was confident of its strength in 1864 and 1865, the authors speculate that the unexpected successes of Generals Grant and Sherman that forced Lee to surrender in April 1865 did not daunt Booth, who may have reasoned that "all was not lost; there were still Confederate armies in the field. Some dramatic action might yet save the Confederacy, and he was the one to do it." Acting on his own initiative, the authors advance, Booth shot Lincoln, then escaped via the route that would have served in the abduction plot. The evidence is, as the authors admit, circumstantial, the argument highly conjectural, the writing frequently infelicitous (an agent "went in to kill Vice-President Andrew Johnson but his courage was not sufficiently screwed up"). Nevertheless, Civil War and military history buffs will be intrigued by the documentation amassed in this hefty book.

The accordion-fold book includes Paul Davis&#39;s bucolic mural in full, which season by season unfolds a country life of bosks and lakes, of nature in perfect harmony. Arcadia chef and co-owner Anne Rosenzweig has created four seasonal menus, each of them offering that sense of warmth, abundance, and bliss of a time wonderfully arcadian.</p><p>Rosenzweig, chef and co-owner of Manhattan's Arcadia restaurant, offers four festive seasonal menus in the New American Cooking style. She marries the urbane and the earthy in such recipes as roast quail with savoy cabbage and kasha, and corn cakes with creme fraiche and caviar. And the fare creatively utilizes natural seasonal offerings: e.g.,the summer menu features chimney-smoked lobster with tarragon butter, summer squash and potato fritters, and lemon-curd mousse with fresh summer berries in almond tuiles. Each dish is matched with appropriate wines, directions are terse but lucid, and culinary experience is assumed. Rosenzweig's meager narrative barely fills a page, but the scarcity of anecdotal material only serves to emphasize thevivid and colorful graphics, which overwhelm the recipes. Davis's multiseasonal mural, which recalls the bucolic, mythic Greek region of Arcadia and hangs in the real-life namesake, is reproduced here in a seminal accordion-fold format. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A History of Canadian Catholics (Volume 20) (McGill-Queen&#x2019;s Studies in the Hist of Re)</h2><p>In A History of Canadian Catholics Terence Fay relates the long story of the Catholic Church and its followers, beginning with how the church and its adherents came to Canada, how the church established itself, and how Catholic spirituality played a part in shaping Canadian society. He also describes how recent social forces have influenced the church. Using an abundance of sources, Fay discusses Gallicanism (French spirituality), Romanism (Roman spirituality), and Canadianism - the indigenisation of Catholic spirituality in the Canadian lifestyle. Fay begins with a detailed look at the struggle of French Catholics to settle a new land, including their encounters with the Amerindians. He analyses the conflict caused by the arrival of the Scottish and Irish Catholics, which threatened Gallican church control. Under Bishops Bourget and Lynch, the church promoted a romantic vision of Catholic unity in Canada. By the end of the century, however, German, Ukrainian, Polish, and Hungarian immigrants had begun to challenge the French and Irish dominance of Catholic life and provide the foundation of a multicultural church. With the creation of the Canadian Catholic Conference in the postwar period these disparate groups were finally drawn into a more unified Canadian church. A History of Canadian Catholics is especially timely for students of religion and history and will also be of interest to the general reader who would like an understanding the development of Catholic roots in Canadian soil.</p><p>CA&#34;Dr Fay offers the student and general reader a sweeping narrative of the history of the Church.&#34; Mark G. McGowan, author of The Waning of the Green: Catholics, the Irish, and Identity in Toronto, 1887-1922 ---- &#34;Fay&#39;s book marks a major advance in bringing together the stories of the Catholic church&#39;s two main linguistic groups, bridging the divide that exists between English-speaking and French-speaking scholars. His accessible style will help lay-people to understand and appreciate their own history.&#34; Brian P.

Today there are more than 31,000 landmark properties woven into daily life, many located in 111 historic districts in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens&#x2014;including 1,347 individual buildings, 117 interior landmarks, and 10 scenic landmarks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Published in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Landmarks Law, and a major exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, <i>Saving Place</i> tells its story in essays by notable New Yorkers and preservationists Robert A.M. Stern, Adele Chatfield-Taylor, Andrew S. Dolkart, Fran�oise Bollack, Anthony C. Wood, and Claudette Brady: its first successes (the Astor Library, now home to The Public Theater), its failures (the Metropolitan Opera House), and its most dramatic turning points, including the Grand Central Terminal case decided in the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978. It evaluates contemporary additions to landmarks (the Hearst Tower, the Jewish Museum), and new buildings in historic districts including Greenwich Village and South Street Seaport.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book includes specially commissioned portfolios of views of historic districts and landmark buildings by the distinguished Dutch architectural photographer Iwan Baan. Encompassing all five boroughs, from Bedford-Stuyvesant to Jackson Heights, these images capture the landmarks at work, historic markers that play a vital role in the fabric of their neighborhoods today. What is built, what is demolished, what is preserved&#x2014;all determine the character and future of the city. A veritable roll call of the places that we could not imagine life without, and an incredible invocation of the many that are gone already, <i>Saving Place </i>will appeal to anyone inspired by New York City.</p><p><b>Andrew S.

With archival photographs, too, the book narrates the preservation movement, from its origins to its later successes and failures. A case study dives into the historic-district designature of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a mostly African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn. But given the impact that the law has had on other cities across the country, the entire book serves as a case study. As director of the preservation program at Columbia, Andrew S. Dolkart, and his coeditor Donald Albrecht, a respected design curator, are the ideal team for this project."<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Architectural Record</i></b><br><br>"Despite being in a seemingly constant state of construction, New York City has managed to keep a great deal of its architectural history intact. A quick look at the city&#x2019;s SoHo area or the centuries-old brownstones that line the streets of quiet Brooklyn neighborhoods reveals there&#x2019;s much more to the Big Apple than towering skyscrapers and new buildings. This is in large part due to the New York City Landmarks Law put in place on April 19, 1965, after the destruction of one of Manhattan&#x2019;s most architecturally significant structures&#x2014;Pennsylvania Station. As local outrage spread over the building&#x2019;s demise, design lovers and city officials came together to support the law, which would go on to save other gems across the five boroughs. In honor of the anniversary of the legislation, the Museum of the City of New York is celebrating with an exhibition and accompanying book,&nbsp;<i>SAVING PLACE: 50 Years of New York City Landmarks</i>. With essays from prominent New York figures, preservationists, and architects, and imagery by noted architectural photographer Iwan Baan, the book and the exhibition are a testament to the importance of history and the role individuals can play in protecting it." <br>&#x2014;<b><i>Architectural Digest&nbsp;</i></b></p><h2>Picasso Mosqueteros: The Late Works 1962-1972</h2><p>This publication features new texts by esteemed Picasso biographer John Richardson, contemporary artist Jeff Koons, and scholars Dakin Hart and Memory Holloway.

But the belief that the historical Jesus is the unique incarnation of God has long been a source of division both within Christendom and beyond, as Christianity comes into contact as never before with the other great religious systems of the world. What if the conviction that Jesus is God&#39;s only Son was founded in error? What if there never was a historical Jesus? What if the Gospels have been misread for two thousand years? In &#34;The Gospel and the Zodiac&#34; Bill Darlison demonstrates that the &#34;Gospel of Mark&#34; - considered the primary document of Christianity - is deliberately structured around the signs of the zodiac. This extraordinary study shows how Christianity relates to other world faiths, and interprets the Gospels in the light of the culture in which they were created, rather than viewing them through the distorting lens of contemporary prejudice. It is a radical new interpretation of the Gospels, and makes an important contribution to the contemporary debate about the existence and significance of Jesus.</p><p>The Reverend Bill Darlison is a life-long scholar of this subject.

The extra-lucid power of his analytical sensitivity makes him the perfect decoder of global culture and its guided information. He reveals the prodigious quality resources of naturist empiricism against the abusive uniformity of rationalist totalitarianism, against the tyranny of ugliness and the iron rule of its straight line." Pierre Restany, <em>Hundertwasser: The Painter-King with the five Skins: The Power of Art</em><br> <br> <strong>Friedensreich Hundertwasser </strong>constantly rebelled against the omnipresent might of rational and pragmatic thought patterns and became a symbolic figure for a non-conformist way of life and an ambassador for a self-determined alternative existence.

He hit audiences like a sledgehammer. Few escaped unscathed. &#34;Everything of value related to exercise can be stated in less than a thousand words, can, in fact, be fairly well covered in a few words, as follows: Train hard, train briefly, train infrequently.&#34; &#34;If and when the government ever takes any meaningful steps in the direction of sanity, which I doubt, it could come to pass that all cases of lower-back pain will be treated first with MedX machines, that any other treatment will be prohibited until and unless MedX treatment has been tried and has failed. A simple federal law to that effect would save the people in this country a minimum of $80,000,000,000.00 a year.&#34;&#34;One advanced bodybuilder asked me as I was trying to explain the machine to him &#39;Do you have to be a genius to use the machine?&#39; And I told him &#39;No, but it helps if you are not an idiot.&#39;&#34; &#34;The next time somebody suggests that you move suddenly during any form of either exercise or testing, smile and walk away, because you are talking to a fool.

Complete, total and utter shock, swaddled in disbelief. The shock was not tied to the fact that Celia was dead, but to the symbol he was looking at on her forehead.<br><br>He knew that symbol.<br><br>He recognized it from both photographs he'd seen originating from crime scenes, and from the nightmares that had haunted his earlier dreams.<br><br>That was the symbol his father, the infamous serial killer, Matthew Colton, used to draw on the foreheads of his victims.<br><br>But those victims were all men of a certain size and age who reminded Matthew of his older, far more successful brother, Big J. It had been Matthew's way of doing away, by proxy, with a man whom he hated with every fiber of his being and whom he blamed for everything that had gone wrong in his life.<br><br>Matthew killed men, not women. The thought echoed over and over in Sam's head. And while Matthew had killed his wife when she stumbled across his heinous secret, he hadn't made a practice of killing young women in their twenties.

The human side of him that was struggling to resurface after being buried for more than twenty years felt obligated to offer some sort of comfort to Celia's sister.<br><br>Zoe looked as if she was bordering on going into shock&#x2014;if she wasn't already there.<br><br>"Zoe&#x2014;" Sam began, then fell silent, at a loss as to what to say next.<br><br>But he didn't have to talk.

"I was just in here and now Celia's dead. Why did I leave her? She'd still be alive if I hadn't left the room. Oh, God, why didn't I stay?" she sobbed.<br><br>Sam looked over her head helplessly toward Ethan. He knew what to do at a crime scene, knew how to defend himself against a killer and knew how to handle himself in all the steps between. But when it came to dealing with something like someone else's grief, or a woman's tears, he hadn't a clue.<br><br>Completely at a loss, he looked toward his older brother for help.<br><br>Ethan picked up his cue effortlessly. "Why don't you come outside, Zoe, get some air?" he suggested gently, trying to take hold of Zoe's arm. He was ready to lead her out of the room.<br><br>But Zoe surprised even herself and remained firm. She shook her head adamantly from side to side.<br><br>"No, I can't leave, I can't leave Celia," she insisted, looking down at her sister's prone body.<br><br>Sam had already felt for the pulse he knew was no longer there. Celia was gone. Whoever had fired the shots knew exactly where to aim.<br><br>Rising to his feet, Sam took a firm hold of Zoe's arm. "You can't do her any good anymore, Zoe. Celia's dead."<br><br>"But why? Who?" Zoe cried, looking at Sam through fresh tears.<br><br>Her last thoughts of Celia had been angry ones. Her last words had been condemning ones.<br><br>How was she supposed to live with that now?<br><br>The guilt of that&#x2014;and of leaving Celia alone to fall prey to her killer in the first place&#x2014;had already begun to eat away at her.<br><br>"Those are my questions exactly," Sam replied evenly. There wasn't a shred of emotion evident in his tone as he asked her pointedly, "What can you tell me?"<br><br>"Sam, don't you think now isn't the time&#x2014;" Ethan began, trying to get Sam to treat Zoe with a little more compassion. Ethan's question indicated he thought the victim's sister looked as if she was a hair's breadth away from coming unglued. Asking her questions right now might just push the poor woman over the line.<br><br>But Sam apparently didn't see it that way.<br><br>"Now is <i>exactly</i> the time," Sam emphasized, looking at Ethan. "While it's all still fresh in her mind." And then he turned back to Zoe. "Zoe?" he asked, looking at her pointedly. "Did you see anyone walk into Celia's room after you left her?"<br><br>Zoe shook her head, wisps of blond hair coming undone and falling about her face and neck. "No," she responded hesitantly. "I don't think so..."<br><br>"You don't <i>think</i> so?" Sam demanded, stretching out the key word and making it all sound almost like an accusation.<br><br>It only caused Zoe to look even more bewildered and at a loss.<br><br>"I don't know. I can't remember," she cried. "Everything's just a huge blur."<br><br>And the fact that it was, frustrated her beyond words. She would have raked through her brain with her fingernails if that would have somehow helped bring the missing details back into focus.<br><br>With Ethan looking on, Sam tried another approach. "All right, why did you walk out in the first place?" he asked.<br><br>She looked at him, stricken. How could she tell him what he wanted to know, knowing it would only humiliate him, embarrass him? Hurt him?<br><br>She would rather die herself than do that to him, especially at a time like this.<br><br>Dead or not, Zoe concluded, Celia didn't deserve a man like Sam.<br><br>"Zoe, why did you walk out?" Sam repeated more forcefully when she didn't answer him.<br><br>"We had an argument," she finally answered in a low, quiet voice.<br><br>"About what?" he pressed.<br><br>"Nothing important," Zoe told him, waving the subject away as fresh tears threatened to choke her for a second time.<br><br>Ethan attempted to step in again. "Sam, her only sister's just been murdered. She's clearly in shock.<br><br>She should see a doctor, not be interrogated right now. And yes, I know I have nothing professional to fall back on like Ridge or Annabel, or Chris&#x2014;or even Trevor," he said, mentioning their other siblings, all of whom, unlike him, were in some branch of law enforcement. "But maybe you shouldn't be the one investigating this murder to begin with."<br><br>Sam gave him a look that most of the law enforcement agents in Granite Gulch had learned to steer clear of. "My town, my case."<br><br>"Your fianc�e," Ethan countered.<br><br>Sam completely ignored the last detail. Instead, he looked at Ethan pointedly. "Did you happen to notice the mark on her forehead?"<br><br>Ethan had focused on the gunshots that had ended Celia's life and then on the victim's screaming sister. Now that his attention had been directed to Celia's forehead, Ethan looked and was immediately stunned.<br><br>Like a man in a trance, he raised his eyes back up to Sam's face. "Oh my God, is that&#x2014;?"<br><br>"Definitely. Just like his signature mark, except the red dot's off center." Sam paused, staring at the bull's-eye. "That might mean something."<br><br>"Yeah, that the old man hasn't figured out how to be in two places at once," Ethan said, pointing out the obvious. "He's in prison, Sam, where he's been for twenty years."<br><br><i>"Almost</i> twenty years," Sam corrected. He was a stickler when it came to facts.<br><br>Ethan conceded the point. "Either way, he couldn't have done this. Besides, the old man only killed men who reminded him of his brother. Celia would have never been mistaken for a man, even in the dark." The second the words were out of his mouth, Ethan suddenly realized that Zoe was still in the room. "Oh, God, I'm sorry, Zoe. I didn't mean&#x2014;"<br><br>But Zoe waved his words away. She was far too numbed by what had happened to take offense at something so trivial.<br><br>"It's all right. I understand. And I want to help." She looked from one man to the other. "I want to help any way I can to find who did this to Celia."<br><br>"Right now, you can help by going and getting yourself checked out by a doctor," Sam told her, undoing the bowtie he had put on under protest for the wedding. He took his cell phone out of his pocket and began to put in a call for backup.<br><br>"I don't need to be checked out," Zoe maintained stubbornly. "I didn't hit my head. I found my sister, murdered. I don't think the doctor's got any kind of medication to treat that." She took a breath, struggling to center herself. "I'm sorry about screaming like that before."<br><br>Sam shrugged. "Under the circumstances, it's understandable."<br><br>"Okay," she said, moving on. "What can I do to help?"<br><br>It was obvious that although she'd always been regarded as the meek sister and as far as he knew, she had always kept pretty much out of the way and in the shadows, Zoe was not about to just fade away until such time as he could get around to questioning her at length.<br><br>But he definitely didn't want her underfoot, either.<br><br>"Okay, you want something to do?" he asked her.<br><br>She was almost eager as she said, "Yes."<br><br>"Tell everyone out there that due to circumstances beyond everyone's control, the wedding's been called off&#x2014;but they can't leave, because someone has to take down their statements." He spared her a preoccupied look. "Do you think you can do that for me?"<br><br>For as long as she could remember, she'd always hated having to break bad news to anyone, let alone an entire gathering of people who had come expecting to have a good time. But this was something that clearly needed to be done and Sam was asking her to do it. She put her own discomfort aside and nodded.<br><br>"Yes, sure, of course. And I'll tell them how very sorry you are that this happened and they had to be put through this."</p><h2>A Is for Apple Take a Peek! Slide and Seek!</h2><p>Product Overview Take a peek!

The literal story of what happened on April 14, 1865, is familiar: Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth, a lunatic enraged by the Union victory and the prospect of black citizenship. Yet who Booth really was&#x2014;besides a killer&#x2014;is less well known. The magnitude of his crime has obscured for generations a startling personal story that was integral to his motivation. <i>My Thoughts Be Bloody, </i>a sweeping family saga, revives an extraordinary figure whose name has been missing, until now, from the story of President Lincoln&#x2019;s death. Edwin Booth, John Wilkes&#x2019;s older brother by four years, was in his day the biggest star of the American stage. He won his celebrity at the precocious age of nineteen, before the Civil War began, when John Wilkes was a schoolboy. Without an account of Edwin Booth, author Nora Titone argues, the real story of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassin has never been told. Using an array of private letters, diaries, and reminiscences of the Booth family, Titone has uncovered a hidden history that reveals the reasons why John Wilkes Booth became this country&#x2019;s most notorious assassin. These ambitious brothers, born to theatrical parents, enacted a tale of mutual jealousy and resentment worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy. From childhood, the stage-struck brothers were rivals for the approval of their father, legendary British actor Junius Brutus Booth. After his death, Edwin and John Wilkes were locked in a fierce contest to claim his legacy of fame. This strange family history and powerful sibling rivalry were the crucibles of John Wilkes&#x2019;s character, exacerbating his political passions and driving him into a life of conspiracy. To re-create the lost world of Edwin and John Wilkes Booth, this book takes readers on a panoramic tour of nineteenth-century America, from the streets of 1840s Baltimore to the gold fields of California, from the jungles of the Isthmus of Panama to the glittering mansions of Gilded Age New York. Edwin, ruthlessly competitive and gifted, did everything he could to lock his younger brother out of the theatrical game. As he came of age, John Wilkes found his plans for stardom thwarted by his older sibling&#x2019;s meteoric rise. Their divergent paths&#x2014;Edwin&#x2019;s an upward race to riches and social prominence, and John&#x2019;s a downward spiral into failure and obscurity&#x2014;kept pace with the hardening of their opposite political views and their mutual dislike. The details of the conspiracy to kill Lincoln have been well documented elsewhere. <i>My Thoughts Be Bloody </i>tells a new story, one that explains for the first time why Lincoln&#x2019;s assassin decided to conspire against the president in the first place, and sets that decision in the context of a bitterly divided family&#x2014;and nation. By the end of this riveting journey, readers will see Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s death less as the result of the war between the North and South and more as the climax of a dark struggle between two brothers who never wore the uniform of soldiers, except on stage.</p><p>Nora Titone studied American History and Literature as an undergraduate at Harvard University, and earned an M.A. in History at the University of California, Berkeley. She has worked as a historical researcher for a range of academics, writers and artists involved in projects about nineteenth-century America.&nbsp; She lives in Chicago and this is her first book.&nbsp;<p><b><b>FOREWORD</b></b></p><p>Filled with ambition, rivalry, betrayal, and tragedy, this story of the celebrated Shakespearean actor Junius Brutus Booth and the two sons, Edwin and John Wilkes, who competed to wear his crown, is as gripping as a fine work of fiction. Yet, given the role that the younger son played in murdering President Abraham Lincoln, <i>My Thoughts Be Bloody</i> is simultaneously an important work of history&#x2014;the best account I have ever read of the complex forces that led John Wilkes Booth to carry a gun into Ford&#x2019;s Theatre on April 14, 1865.</p><p>Spanning nearly three-quarters of a century, the book carries us back to early nineteenth-century London, where Junius Booth, handsome, tormented, and brilliant, is the toast of the town. Married with a small child, he falls in love with nineteen-year-old Mary Ann Holmes. Abandoning his family, he flees with his mistress to America, where he begins a new family and becomes a towering star, traveling from one city to the next, delivering passionate performances of Richard III, Hamlet, and King Lear.</p><p>Early on, Nora Titone convincingly argues, two of Junius&#x2019;s four surviving sons give promise of following in their father&#x2019;s footsteps. But which of the two would succeed&#x2014;the more intelligent, sensitive Edwin or the handsomer, more aggressive John Wilkes&#x2014;is unclear. When Junius chooses the older son, Edwin, to accompany him on the road, a fierce jealousy begins to fester in John Wilkes. Though Edwin finds traveling with his hard-drinking father difficult, he begins to experience the magic of the theater. On his own, he memorizes long passages from Shakespeare; he absorbs his father&#x2019;s gestures, accents, and facial expressions. He hungers for the fame his father has achieved.</p><p>Edwin&#x2019;s chance comes when Junius suddenly dies. As throngs of mourners gather for the funeral procession, the nineteen-year-old Edwin assumes his father&#x2019;s mantle and soon becomes a greater star than Junius ever was. In contrast to his father&#x2019;s bombastic style, he mesmerizes audiences with the naturalness of his performances and his conversational tone. Critics rate his first performance as Richard III &#x201c;a blaze of genius.&#x201d; Moving from one triumph to another, he becomes a wealthy man when still in his early twenties.</p><p>When John Wilkes comes of age, he too becomes an actor. His handsome features and well-proportioned body hold promise, but he possesses neither the talent nor the discipline to become a star. Edwin fears that his brother will dilute the family name and that two Booths on the same circuit will cut into his profits, even though he is, by far, the better known. He has power to wield, however, so he divides the United States into two regions. Each brother would perform in his own region, never crossing into the other&#x2019;s territory. Edwin takes the populous North, including New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia, while John Wilkes is relegated to the less populous South, where audiences and profits are much smaller. John Wilkes begins his first Southern tour in 1860, as the country itself is dividing along the same lines as his brother&#x2019;s map.</p><p>Toiling in the South, John Wilkes begins to sympathize with the Confederate cause, increasing tensions with his Union-loving family. After performing in New Orleans, where he meets up with members of the Confederate Secret Service, John Wilkes finally finds his chance for stardom by joining the conspiracy to kidnap President Lincoln. His decision, Titone persuasively argues, is forged as much by his failed career, his squandered earnings, and his jealousy of his brother&#x2019;s success, as by his politics or his hatred for Lincoln.</p><p>In short, this book forces us to look at the familiar story of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassin in a new way&#x2014;through the lens of his tangled family history. Moreover, by placing Edwin Booth at center stage, it brings back to vivid life a fascinating figure whose achievements have been obscured by his brother&#x2019;s murderous deed. We see Edwin performing before President Lincoln, dining with Secretary of State William Seward, befriending Julia Ward Howe and Adam Badeau, General Grant&#x2019;s aide-de-camp. We learn that no other actor in the golden age of nineteenth-century theater was ever held in higher esteem. Still, as Titone appreciates, through a final desperate performance, John Wilkes Booth accomplished by death what he had never been able to achieve in life&#x2014;he finally upstaged his brother.</p><p>&#x2014;Doris Kearns Goodwin<br> April 29, 2010<br> Concord, Massachusetts</p><p>� 2010 Nora Titone</p></p><h2>Sugar Snaps and Strawberries: Simple Solutions for Creating Your Own Small-Space Edible Garden</h2><p>Imagine savoring fresh-picked strawberries on a weekend morning, plucking plump figs from your mini-orchard to quarter and serve at a farm-to-table meal with friends, or harvesting and saut�ing the edible stalks of garlic bulbs.

And each year new voices rise up to the Jerusalem sky, where so many miracles have been witnessed.</p><p>Mark Podwal is the author and illustrator of numerous books, including <i>A Sweet Yea</i>r. His art has appeared in publications such as <i>The New York Times</i>. He lives in New York City.*Starred Review* Gr. 3-5. The religious history of Jerusalem is as omnipresent in the sky above, as it is in the city itself. In short, with beautiful poems and vivid, impressionistic artwork, Podwal captures the hope and tears the city evokes among followers of the three monotheistic religions of the world. Calling on both history and myth ("Some believe that halfway between heaven and earth, the Jerusalem sky is home to a city with walls of silver, gates of pearl, and streets of gold"), Podwal paints word pictures of Jerusalem's special nature and explains why Judaism, Christianity, and Islam hold it holy. For instance, "Christians tell of a wondrous star in the Jerusalem sky . . . . And they tell how thirty-three years later, a spring afternoon's daylight blackened into a starless sky." The pictures hint of Chagall, with readers using their softer sight to make out the images. The colors, though, are vivid: the pinks and golds of the city's stones, the oranges and greens from the groves, and the myriad blues of the sky. Put this in the hands of children, and talk to them about hope rather than hostilities. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From <em>Silk to Silicon</em> tells the story of who these men and women were, what they did, how they did it and how their achievements continue to shape our world today. They include:</p><p>� Genghis Khan, who united east and west by conquest and by opening new trade routes built on groundbreaking transportation, communications, and management innovations.</p><p>� Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who arose from an oppressive Jewish ghetto to establish the most powerful bank the world has seen, and ushered in an era of global finance.</p><p>� Cyrus Field, who became the father of global communications by leading the effort to build the transatlantic telegraph, the forerunner to global radio, TV, and the worldwide Internet.</p><p>� Margaret Thatcher, whose controversial policies opened the gusher of substantially free markets that linked economies across borders.</p><p>� Andy Grove, a Hungarian refugee from the Nazis who built the company&#x2014;Intel&#x2014;that figured out how to manufacture complex computer chips on a mass, commercial scale and laid the foundation for Silicon Valley&#x2019;s computer revolution.</p><p>Through these stories Jeffrey E. Garten finds the common links between these figure and probes critical questions including: How much influence can any one person have in fundamentally changing the world? And how have past trends in globalization affected the present and how will they shape the future? <em>From Silk to Silicon</em> is an essential book to understanding the past&#x2014;and the future&#x2014;of the most powerful force of our times.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2016:</strong> Globalization has been happening for a lot longer than there has been a word to describe it. In <em>From Silk to Silicon</em>, Jeffrey E. Garten of the Yale School of Management examines the lives of ten people whose actions contributed to the history of globalization. He begins with Genghis Khan, who did much to open up trade in his time, and ends chronologically with Deng Xiaoping, who reformed the Chinese economy and drew millions of Chinese workers into the modern market. In between, he touches on such disparate characters as Margaret Thatcher (free markets), John D. Rockefeller (multinationals) and Andrew Grove (Intel and the microchip). Garten could have picked ten different people to populate his book, but that&#x2019;s not the point. The spread of globalization has been built on the pieces that came before it, and individuals have both been impacted and found ways to make an impact. This is an interesting approach to telling the story of globalization. <em>--Chris Schluep</em><p>Jeffrey E.

Laurence did not have time in the heat of the battle to be surprised at the degree of resistance, but even through the numbing haze of battle-fever and the confusion of swords and pistol-smoke, he marked the extreme look of anguish on the French captain&#x2019;s face as the man shouted encouragement to his men.<br><br>It was still there shortly thereafter, when they met on the deck, and the man surrendered his sword, very reluctantly: at the last moment his hand half-closed about the blade, as if he meant to draw it back. Laurence looked up to make certain the colors had been struck, then accepted the sword with a mute bow; he did not speak French himself, and a more formal exchange would have to wait for the presence of his third lieutenant, that young man being presently engaged belowdecks in securing the French guns. With the cessation of hostilities, the remaining Frenchmen were all virtually dropping where they stood; Laurence noticed that there were fewer of them than he would have expected for a frigate of thirty-six guns, and that they looked ill and hollow-cheeked.<br><br>Many of them lay dead or dying upon the deck; he shook his head at the waste and eyed the French captain with disapproval: the man should never have offered battle. Aside from the plain fact that the Reliant would have had the Amiti� slightly outgunned and outmanned under the best of circumstances, the crew had obviously been reduced by disease or hunger. To boot, the sails above them were in a sad tangle, and that no result of the battle, but of the storm which had passed but this morning; they had barely managed to bring off a single broadside before the Reliant had closed and boarded. The captain was obviously deeply overset by the defeat, but he was not a young man to be carried away by his spirits: he ought to have done better by his men than to bring them into so hopeless an action.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Riley,&#x201d; Laurence said, catching his second lieutenant&#x2019;s attention, &#x201c;have our men carry the wounded below.&#x201d; He hooked the captain&#x2019;s sword on his belt; he did not think the man deserved the compliment of having it returned to him, though ordinarily he would have done so. &#x201c;And pass the word for Mr. Wells.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very good, sir,&#x201d; Riley said, turning to issue the necessary orders. Laurence stepped to the railing to look down and see what damage the hull had taken. She looked reasonably intact, and he had ordered his own men to avoid shots below the waterline; he thought with satisfaction that there would be no difficulty in bringing her into port.<br><br>His hair had slipped out of his short queue, and now fell into his eyes as he looked over. He impatiently pushed it out of the way as he turned back, leaving streaks of blood upon his forehead and the sun-bleached hair; this, with his broad shoulders and his severe look, gave him an unconsciously savage appearance as he surveyed his prize, very unlike his usual thoughtful expression.<br><br>Wells climbed up from below in response to the summons and came to his side. &#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; he said, without waiting to be addressed, &#x201c;begging your pardon, but Lieutenant Gibbs says there is something queer in the hold.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh? I will go and look,&#x201d; Laurence said. &#x201c;Pray tell this gentleman,&#x201d; he indicated the French captain, &#x201c;that he must give me his parole, for himself and his men, or they must be confined.&#x201d;<br><br>The French captain did not immediately respond; he looked at his men with a miserable expression. They would of course do much better if they could be kept spread out through the lower deck, and any recapture was a practical impossibility under the circumstances; still he hesitated, drooped, and finally husked, &#x201c;Je me rends,&#x201d; with a look still more wretched.<br><br>Laurence gave a short nod. &#x201c;He may go to his cabin,&#x201d; he told Wells, and turned to step down into the hold. &#x201c;Tom, will you come along? Very good.&#x201d;<br><br>He descended with Riley on his heels, and found his first lieutenant waiting for him. Gibbs&#x2019;s round face was still shining with sweat and emotion; he would be taking the prize into port, and as she was a frigate, he almost certainly would be made post, a captain himself. Laurence was only mildly pleased; though Gibbs had done his duty reasonably, the man had been imposed on him by the Admiralty and they had not become intimates. He had wanted Riley in the first lieutenant&#x2019;s place, and if he had been given his way, Riley would now be the one getting his step. That was the nature of the service, and he did not begrudge Gibbs the good fortune; still, he did not rejoice quite so wholeheartedly as he would have to see Tom get his own ship.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well; what&#x2019;s all this, then?&#x201d; Laurence said now; the hands were clustered about an oddly placed bulkhead towards the stern area of the hold, neglecting the work of cataloguing the captured ship&#x2019;s stores.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, if you will step this way,&#x201d; Gibbs said. &#x201c;Make way there,&#x201d; he ordered, and the hands backed away from what Laurence now saw was a doorway set inside a wall that had been built across the back of the hold; recently, for the lumber was markedly lighter than the surrounding planks.<br><br>Ducking through the low door, he found himself in a small chamber with a strange appearance. The walls had been reinforced with actual metal, which must have added a great deal of unnecessary weight to the ship, and the floor was padded with old sailcloth; in addition, there was a small coal-stove in the corner, though this was not presently in use. The only object stored within the room was a large crate, roughly the height of a man&#x2019;s waist and as wide, and this was made fast to the floor and walls by means of thick hawsers attached to metal rings.<br><br>Laurence could not help feeling the liveliest curiosity, and after a moment&#x2019;s struggle he yielded to it. &#x201c;Mr. Gibbs, I think we shall have a look inside,&#x201d; he said, stepping out of the way. The top of the crate was thoroughly nailed down, but eventually yielded to the many willing hands; they pried it off and lifted out the top layer of packing, and many heads craned forward at the same time to see.<br><br>No one spoke, and in silence Laurence stared at the shining curve of eggshell rising out of the heaped straw; it was scarcely possible to believe. &#x201c;Pass the word for Mr. Pollitt,&#x201d; he said at last; his voice sounded only a little strained. &#x201c;Mr. Riley, pray be sure those lashings are quite secure.&#x201d;<br><br>Riley did not immediately answer, too busy staring; then he jerked to attention and said, hastily, &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; and bent to check the bindings.<br><br>Laurence stepped closer and gazed down at the egg. There could hardly be any doubt as to its nature, though he could not say for sure from his own experience. The first amazement passing, he tentatively reached out and touched the surface, very cautiously: it was smooth and hard to the touch. He withdrew almost at once, not wanting to risk doing it some harm.<br><br>Mr. Pollitt came down into the hold in his awkward way, clinging to the ladder edges with both hands and leaving bloody prints upon it; he was no kind of a sailor, having become a naval surgeon only at the late age of thirty, after some unspecified disappointments on land. He was nevertheless a genial man, well liked by the crew, even if his hand was not always the steadiest at the operating table. &#x201c;Yes, sir?&#x201d; he said, then saw the egg. &#x201c;Good Lord above.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is a dragon egg, then?&#x201d; Laurence said. It required an effort to restrain the triumph in his voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes indeed, Captain, the size alone shows that.&#x201d; Mr. Pollitt had wiped his hands on his apron and was already brushing more straw away from the top, trying to see the extent. &#x201c;My, it is quite hardened already; I wonder what they can have been thinking, so far from land.&#x201d;<br><br>This did not sound very promising. &#x201c;Hardened?&#x201d; Laurence said sharply. &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, that it will hatch soon. I will have to consult my books to be certain, but I believe that Badke&#x2019;s Bestiary states with authority that when the shell has fully hardened, hatching will occur within a week. What a splendid specimen, I must get my measuring cords.&#x201d;<br><br>He bustled away, and Laurence exchanged a glance with Gibbs and Riley, moving closer so they might speak without being overheard by the lingering gawkers. &#x201c;At least three weeks from Madeira with a fair wind, would you say?&#x201d; Laurence said quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;At best, sir,&#x201d; Gibbs said, nodding.<br><br>&#x201c;I cannot imagine how they came to be here with it,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;What do you mean to do, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>His initial satisfaction turning gradually into dismay as he realized the very difficult situation, Laurence stared at the egg blankly. Even in the dim lantern light, it shone with the warm luster of marble. &#x201c;Oh, I am damned if I know, Tom. But I suppose I will go and return the French captain his sword; it is no wonder he fought so furiously after all.&#x201d;<br>Except of course he did know; there was only one possible solution, unpleasant as it might be to contemplate. Laurence watched broodingly while the egg was transferred, still in its crate, over to the Reliant: the only grim man, except for the French officers. He had granted them the liberty of the quarterdeck, and they watched the slow process glumly from the rail. All around them, smiles wreathed every sailor&#x2019;s face, private, gloating smiles, and there was a great deal of jostling among the idle hands, with many unnecessary cautions and pieces of advice called out to the sweating group of men engaged in the actual bus...</p><h2>Someone With Me</h2><p>Compelling in its honesty, this is William Kurelek&#39;s life...as only he could tell it.

An occasional bright flash silhouetted the rounded height, causing shadows to flit briefly across the valley of Araglin within its northern foothills. It was a dark night with storm clouds clustering and racing across the heaven, tumbling over each other as if blown in disarray by the powerful breath of the ancient gods.On the high pastures, the shaggy-coated cattle huddled together, some bellowing fretfully now and then, not just to comfort themselves from the threatening storm but to warn one another of the prevailing scent of ravening wolves whose hungry packs haunted the dark woodlands which bordered the high meadows. In a corner of the pastures, well away from the cattle, a majestic stag stood as an anxious sentinel over his hinds and their calves. Now and then he would thrust his elaborately antlered head skyward and his sensitive nostrils would quiver. In spite of the darkness, the heavy clouds and threatening storm, the beast sensed the approach of dawn beyond the distant eastern peaks.Below in the valley, by the dark, gurgling ribbon of a river, a group of unfortified buildings stood in complete darkness. No dogs were stirring at this hour and it was still too early for the cocks to herald the approach of a new day. Even the birds had not begun their dawn chorus and were still sheltering sleepily in the surrounding trees.Yet one human was stirring at this dark hour; one person wasawakening at this hour of stillness when the world seemed dead and deserted.Menma, the head stableman to Eber, chieftain of Araglin, a tall, ponderous man with a bushy red beard and a fondness for liquor, blinked and threw off the sheepskin from his straw palliasse bed. The occasional flash of lightning lit his solitary cabin. Menma groaned and shook his head as if the action would clear it from the effects of the previous night's drinking. He reached to a table and, with shaky hands, fumbled for the flint and tinder to light the tallow candle which stood upon it. Then he stretched his cramped limbs. In spite of his excessive drinking, Menma was possessed of a mysterious in-built sense of time. All his life he had risen in the dark hour before dawn no matter the lateness of the hour at which he had tumbled, in drunken stupor, into his bed.The big man began his ritual morning cursing of all creation. Menma had a fondness for cursing. Some people began the day with a prayer, others by performing their morning's ablutions. Menma of Araglin began his day by cursing his master, the chieftain Eber, wishing upon him all manner of deaths by choking, by convulsion, by mangling, by dysentery, by poison, by drowning, by smothering and by any other means his meagre imagination could devise. And after he had exhausted such manner of ill-wishing on his master, Menma continued cursing his own existence, his parents for not being rich and powerful; cursing them for being only simple farming folk and thereby ordaining for him a role as a lowly stableman.His own parents had been simple labourers on their richer cousins' farmsteads. They had not succeeded in life and had ordained Menma's own menial existence. Menma was a jealous and bitter man, unhappy with his lot in life.Nevertheless, he rose automatically in the darkness of the early morning and drew on his clothes. He never bothered to wash nor comb the matted tangle of his shoulder-length, red-coloured hairand the great bush of his beard. A gulping draught of <i>corma,</i> the sickly mead that always stood in a jug by his bedside, was all the cleansing he deemed necessary to prepare him for the day. The stench of his body and garments proclaimed, to those near enough to inhale their malefic odour, that Menma and cleanliness were not compatible.He shuffled to the door of his cabin and peered out, blinking up at the darken sky. The thunder still rumbled but he instinctively knew that it would not rain that day in the valley. The storm was on the other side of the mountains and moving along them east to west, keeping parallel to the valley of Araglin. It would not cross northward over the mountains. No; it would be a dry day even if cloudy and cool. The clouds obscured the stars so that he was unable to be precise about the time but he sensed, rather than saw, the pale line of dawn just below the distant eastern peaks.The <i>rath</i> of the chieftain of Araglin still slumbered in the darkness. Although this was no more than an unfortified village, it was courtesy to call the dwelling of a chieftain a <i>rath</i> or fortress.Menma stood at his door and now he began to softly curse the day itself. He resented the fact that everyone was able to sleep on but that he had to be the first to rise. And when he had finished with the day there was Araglin itself to be cursed and he did full justice to his scanty vocabulary.He turned back into his cabin for a moment and blew out the candle before beginning to shuffle along the track that led between the peaceful buildings towards the chieftain's stables. He needed no candle for he had often walked that path before. His first task would be to turn the horses out to pasture, feed the chieftain's hunting hounds, and then to oversee the milking of the chieftain's cattle. And by the time the horses were out in the pasture and the hounds were fed, then the women of the household would be awake and coming to attend the milking. Milking was not a man's job and Menma would not demean himself by doing it. But there had been a cattle raid in the valley recently and Eber, the chieftain,had instructed him to check the milch herd before each milking. It was an affront to the honour of the chieftain that anyone would dare steal even a calf from his herd and Eber had been furious at the news that cattle raiders were threatening the peace of his clan lands. His warriors had scoured the countryside for the culprits but without success.Menma approached the imposing dark outline of the hall of assembly, one of the few great large stone buildings within the ancient <i>rath.</i> The other stone building was Father Gorm�n's chapel. The stables were at the back of the rounded construction, just behind the guests' hostel. To approach the stables, Menma had to trudge a circular path around the wooden extensions to the stone hall which housed the private apartments of the chieftain and his family. Menma glanced at the buildings in jealousy. Eber would still be snoring in his bed until well after dawn.Behind his veil of beard, Menna grinned lewdly. He wondered if anyone was sharing Eber's bed that night. Then he frowned angrily. Why Eber? Why not him? What was so special about Eber that he had wealth, power and was able to entice women into his bed? What fate had made him a humble stableman? Why ... ?He paused in mid-stride, head to one side.The darkness seemed soundless. The <i>rath</i> continued to slumber. High, high up among the distant hills came the long, drawn out howl of a wolf breaking the silence. No; it was not that which had caused him to halt. It had been some other noise. A noise he could not quite place.He stood for a moment more but the silence remained. He was just about to dismiss the half heard sound as a trick of the wind when it came again.A low, moaning sound.<i>Was</i> it the wind?Menma suddenly genuflected and shivered. God between him and all evil! Was it one of the dwellers in the hills? The people ofthe <i>s�dh;</i> the little folk in search of souls to carry below into their dark caverns?There came a sudden shriek, not loud but sharp enough to make Menma start, his heart increasing its beat for several seconds. Then the low moaning came again. This time it was a little stronger and more sustained.Menma looked around him. Nothing stirred among the dark shadows of the buildings. No one else seemed to have heard the noise. He tried to locate its origin. It came from the direction of the apartments of Eber himself. In spite of its ethereal quality, Menma could now identify it as human in origin. He sighed in relief for, as brutal in his views of the world as he was, nevertheless, it did not bode well to go up against the folk of the <i>s�dh</i> if they were intent on soul-stealing. He glanced quickly about. The building appeared dark and tranquil. Was Eber ill? He frowned, undecided what to do. Eber was his chieftain, come what may, and Menma had a duty to his chieftain. A duty which not even his bitterness could cause him to neglect.He cautiously made his way to the door of Eber's apartments and tapped softly.'Eber? Are you ill? Do you require assistance?' he called gently.There was no reply. He tapped again, a little louder. When there was still no response, he summoned courage and lifted the latch. The door was not secured, not that he expected it to be. No one secured their doors in the <i>rath</i> of the chieftain of Araglin. He moved inside. He had no trouble adjusting his eyes to the darkness. The room which he had entered was empty. He knew from previous experience that Eber's apartments consisted of two rooms. The first room, in which he stood, was called 'the place of conversation', which was a private reception room for the chieftain, where he discreetly entertained special guests, away from the public gaze of the hall of assembly. Beyond this room was the chieftain's bed chamber.Menma, having ascertained the first room to be empty, turned towards it.The first thing he noticed was a glow of light from beneath the door. The second thing that registered with him was the rising sound of the moaning beyond the door.'Eber!' he called sharply. 'Is there anything wrong? It is I, Menma the stableman.'There was no reply and the moaning sound did not diminish.He moved across to the door and rapped sharply.Hesitating only for a moment, he entered.A lamp was lit on a small table. Menma blinked rapidly to adjust his vision. He was aware of someone kneeling by the bed, someone in a hunched posture, rocking back and forth and whimpering. They were the source of the low moaning sound that he had been hearing. He was aware of the dark stains on the clothes of the figure. Then his eyes widened a fraction. They were blood stains and there was something flashing and glinting in the lamplight, something that the person was clutching in their hands. It was a long bladed dagger.For a moment, Menma stood immobile, fascinated by the spectacle.Then he realised that there was a second person in the room. Someone was lying in the bed beside which the moaning figure was kneeling.Menma stood a pace forward.Sprawled on the bed, naked except for the coverlets twisted around him, was the blood-smeared body of Eber the chieftain. One hand was thrown casually back behind his head. The eyes were wide and staring and seemed alive in the flickering of the lamplight. The chest was a mess of bloody wounds. Menma had seen enough animals slaughtered not to recognise the jagged tearing of injuries caused by a knife. The knife must have been frenziedly plunged, again and again, into the chest of the chieftain of Araglin.Menma half raised his hand to genuflect but then dropped it.'Is he dead?' he demanded hollowly.The figure beside the bed continued to rock back and forth moaning. It did not look up.Menma took another step forward and gazed dispassionately downwards. Then he moved closer, dropping to one knee and reaching towards the pulse in the chieftain's neck. The body already felt cool and clammy. Now that he looked more closely into the eyes, and the lamplight played no tricks with them, he could see that they were set and glazed.Menma drew himself up and stared down in distaste. He hesitated, feeling that in spite of the evidence of his eyes, he had to make sure that Eber was dead. He raised a foot to nudge at the body with the toe of his boot. There was no response. Then he raised his foot and lashed viciously out at the side of the body. No, he was not mistaken. Eber, the chieftain, was dead.Menma turned his gaze to the still moaning figure, which was still clutching the knife. He began to laugh harshly. He suddenly realised that he, Menma the stableman, was going to be rich and powerful just like the cousins he had envied all his life.He was still chuckling when he left the chieftain's apartments and set off in search of Duban, the commander of Eber's bodyguard.THE SPIDER'S WEB.

He has been dating Rachel Gilbert since they were both sixteen and now, to the relief and happiness of the entire Gilbert family, they are finally to marry. To Adam, Rachel embodies the highest values of Temple Fortune; she is innocent, conventional, and entirely secure in her community--a place in which everyone still knows the whereabouts of their nursery school classmates. Marrying Rachel will cement Adam's role in a warm, inclusive family he loves.<br><br>But as the vast machinery of the wedding gathers momentum, Adam feels the first faint touches of claustrophobia, and when Rachel's younger cousin Ellie Schneider moves home from New York, she unsettles Adam more than he'd care to admit. Ellie--beautiful, vulnerable, and fiercely independent--offers a liberation that he hadn't known existed: a freedom from the loving interference and frustrating parochialism of North West London. Adam finds himself questioning everything, suddenly torn between security and exhilaration, tradition and independence. What might he be missing by staying close to home?<br><br>Francesca Segal was born in London and studied at Oxford and Harvard University before becoming a journalist and critic.

Barris devotes much--too much--space here to his recent retirement years in St. Tropez, focusing on his friendships with some eccentric Frenchman and his obsession with the game of boule. He also ventures such comments on his current hosts as, ``Frenchmen never change their clothes...And Frenchmen don't bathe, at least most of the Parisian taxi drivers don't.'' But the one-time (mostly 70's) Nielsen darling hasn't completely forgotten his audience, and in between the French sections he serves up a ribald account of his time at the top, going right for the groin on his opening page, a description of the notorious episode on The Gong Show (on which bad acts performed until a celebrity judge slammed a mallet into a giant gong) that featured the Popsicle Twins, pretty teenagers who performed fellatio on orange popsicles. Readers who venture further will learn about the early days of Barris's first show, The Dating Game, originally plagued by obscenity-spouting contestants; about the author's first big TV special, featuring rock-'n'-roller Cass Elliot, who ``was most definitely fat. And dank''; about how Barris was masturbated during dinner by a 17-year-old ``with the face of a sad horse'' while future Hollywood powerhouse Mike Medavoy danced with a lampshade on his head; and about how, back in France, Ted Kennedy cavorted on Barris's yacht. There's a bit of introspection, too (``some of those antics of mine can make me moan with embarrassment''), perhaps prompted by a 60-ish Barris's recent, failed comeback attempt, schlepping projects around L.A. to no avail. Which isn't surprising, judging from this latest Barris product, which deserves, with little ado, a big...Gong! (Photographs--not seen) (First printing of 40,000) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This autobiography may surprise some readers: while Barris covers his many successful television game shows in some detail, his primary emphasis is on his retirement years in St. Tropez. (He also describes one unhappy return trip to L.A., which convinced him that he didn't want to go home again.) Starting in 1965 with The Dating Game , Barris racked up hit after hit with shows like The Newlywed Game , Dream Girls , The Family Game , The Parent Game , The $1.98 Beauty Show and his most famous and controversial effort, The Gong Show , considered sadistic by many because it featured individuals with minimal talents or skills otherwise unmarketable. Barris ruled the field until 1986, when he moved to the Riviera. France and the French irritated him considerably, but they were real--which, he discovered on his return to La La Land, Hollywood was not. Enlivened by many amusing anecdotes, this is a good read. 40,000 first printing; $40,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Karin Rosenthal-Twenty Years Of Photographs</h2><p>This book create elegrant abstracts, that are senual but not erotic.</p><p>We are proud to bring this collection of photographs to the public.

Wanting to make statements about human nature as I had before in portraits and street pictures, I sought a way to photograph people in water to create images of a psychological, dreamlike, and emotive nature. When I began the Nudes in Water series in 1975, I felt that water, the source of all life, should display an equivalent density to flesh, invoking a cauldron of creation and a visceral visual connection between body and nature. These motivations were to become the foundation for all photographs that followed.&#34; (Karin Rosenthal)</p><h2>Do Yourself a Favour - Forgive: Learn How to Take Control of Your Life Through Forgiveness</h2><p>Forgiveness is easier said than done and is one of the most difficult personal issues to deal with. When people fail to forgive, it damages - often ruins - relationships, causes stress and other health problems and can turn life and work into a prison of the mind. Without forgiveness, anger and bitterness become a cauldron of poison. The anger doesn&#39;t go away - it just gets worse.In DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR ... FORGIVE, Joyce Meyer helps the reader transform the simple phrase &#39;I forgive you&#39; into a statement of true meaning that can take relationships to a deeper level.By addressing where the need to forgive comes from, Joyce teaches readers to understand the importance of forgiveness, rather than letting anger&#39;s destructive forces take over their lives.</p><p>Joyce Meyer is a wonderful Bible teacher and Hodder Faith is proud to publish her in the UK.

This was the childhood of the four Madsen children who made their home aboard a four-masted sailing bark that carried cargo in the 1800s. Based on the journal kept by Captain Madsen and his daughter Ena, the story of this seafaring family is brought to life for modern children by Gloria and Ted Rand. Culminating in a dramatic Christmas Eve storm at sea, this is at once a rousing adventure and an intriguing look at a unique lifestyle that will fascinate young and old alike.</p><p>Gloria Rand and Ted Rand have collaborated on several picture books for Holt, including ""Salty Dog"" and ""Prince William,""<br>With emotional range and plenty of historical detail, this picture book follows four children who grow up sailing the oceans on the John Ena, a four-masted cargo ship for which their father is captain. Young Matilda narrates the days when "every morning we woke up far away from where we'd gone to sleep." Working from the journal of the Madsens, a real 19th-century seafaring family, the Rands (Baby in a Basket) pack the pages with remarkable facts. Balls bounce overboard, so Matilda and her siblings play catch on deck with beanbags instead. The family buys gifts for Christmas and birthdays months ahead of time on long voyages. And when the seas grow rough, they must tie furniture to the walls and secure it to the floor. The book carries readers from cheerful anecdotes about pets and games to a gripping description of the heroism of the children's parents when their ship broaches (rolls onto its side): "Neither of them showed any panic or fear, and that made us children feel brave, too." Skillfully drafted watercolor spreads often show action at an angle to convey the sense of the ship pitching on the waves, and suggest a life of constant motion. An afterword with period photographs describes the Madsens' post-oceangoing life. Even landlocked readers will feel the pull of the high seas in this suspenseful memoir. Ages 5-8. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Stoneflight</h2><p>Janie uses her power to put life in the stone animals that ornament New York buildings to escape her parents&#39; quarreling, but when the animals start to turn her into stone she learns that having feelings is the price of remaining human.</p><p></p><h2>Dragonar Academy Vol. 8</h2><p><p>LOST AND FOUND</p><p>Ash, Eco, and Sylvia are back in Ansullivan after the confrontation with Mordred, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean things are back to normal.

"West Coast jazz," as it soon became known, was a fresh new sound which stirred both controversy and excitement in equal measure. One thing, however, was certain: never before (or since) had so many jazz musicians from the Coast made such an impact on jazz. Dave Brubeck, Dexter Gordon, Art Pepper, Chet Baker, Eric Dolphy, Paul Desmond, Ornette Coleman, Cal Tjader, Shelly Manne, and numerous others--these figures shaped the jazz of their time and are still powerful influences today.<br> In <em>West Coast Jazz</em>, Ted Gioia provides the definitive account of this rich, evocative music. Drawing on years of research and numerous first-hand interviews, Gioia tells the full story of West Coast jazz, from its early stirrings after World War II to its decline after 1960. He traces its growth from its origins on Central Avenue, the heart of LA's post-war black culture, "an elongated Harlem set down by the Pacific," where hotels such as the Dunbar (where Jack Johnson opened a nightclub) and nightspots such as the Club Alabam and The Downbeat attracted the likes of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and any number of visiting jazz luminaries. He describes one of the pivotal moments in the genesis of West Coast jazz, the night Dizzy and Bird opened at Billy Berg's Vine Street club, a legendary performance that sparked California's love affair with jazz. And he traces its blossoming at the Blackhawk, the Lighthouse, Bop City, the Haig and a host of other legendary California nightspots. Along the way, Gioia not only provides colorful portraits of leading jazz figures--such as Dexter Gordon, a stoop to his walk, carrying his tenor in a sack under his arm--and thoughtful commentary on their music, but he also discusses many unsung figures as well. Perhaps most important, though, is his lengthy look at Dave Brubeck, which is by far the best biography ever written of this influential musician.<br> West Coast jazz gradually declined as the 1950s gave way to the rock-dominated '60s, but this decade-long renaissance remains one of the great stories of jazz history, and nobody has told it as well as Ted Gioia does here. His love of this music shines on every page.</p><p>"A book that desperately needed to be written and has turned out to be a surprise landmark and masterpiece."&nbsp;--Bruce and Joel Klauber, <i>Jazziz</i>&nbsp;"Gioia writes with the musical knowledge of a jazzman and the immediacy of a reporter, in language that has a casual grace."&nbsp;--Bill Kisliuk, San Francisco Review of Books&nbsp;"Ted Gioia is very much a West Coast jazz partisan, and his informed enthusiasm and wide-ranging research make West Coast Jazz a highly rewarding and arguable book. . . . Makes a large, disparate, unruly subject not only coherent but also intriguing."&nbsp;--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;"While the requisite space is devoted to such cool icons as Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker, Gioia also takes an expert, often iconoclastic look at the careers of other West Coast jazz men, both well-known and obscure. . . . Anyone looking for a basic history of the California scene should start with this smart, opinionated book."&nbsp;--Chris Morris, <i>Billboard</i><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Ted Gioia</strong> was born in Los Angeles in 1957. He was a founder of Stanford's Jazz Studies program and has taught jazz history and performance there. Gioia has made two recordings as a jazz pianist, and has produced a series of recordings featuring the work of younger West Coast musicians. His first book, <em>The Imperfect Art</em>, was a winner of The ASCAP Deems-Taylor Award.<br></p><h2>New Taboos (Outspoken Authors, 11)</h2><p><p>Mixing outlaw humor, sci-fi adventure, and cutting social criticism, this collection draws upon John Shirley&#x2019;s entire arsenal.

The book&#x2019;s thesis is that the origins of women&#x2019;s oppression lie in biology: in the fact that it is women and not men who conceive and give birth to children. Firestone&#x2019;s solution is revolutionary: since it is biology that is the problem, then biology must be changed, through technological intervention that would have as its end the complete removal of the reproductive process from women&#x2019;s bodies. With its proposal for the development of artificial wombs, its call for the abolition of the nuclear family and its vision of a cybernetic future, Firestone&#x2019;s manifesto may seem hopelessly out-dated, a far-fetched, utopian hangover of Swinging Sixties radicalism. This book, on the contrary, will argue for its importance to the resurgent feminism of today as a text that interrogates issues around gender, biology, sexuality, work and technology, and the ways in which our imaginations in the 21st century continue to be in thrall to ideologies of maternity and the nuclear family.</p><p>Dr Victoria Margree is Principal Lecturer at the University of Brighton, where she teaches feminist politics and theory, literature, critical theory and conflict studies.

In a most unlikely request, Heidi, a notorious gold digger recently separated from her latest husband, recruits the Boston P.I. to accompany her to her private island, Tashtego. The reason? To attend her daughter&#x2019;s wedding as a sort of stand-in husband and protector. Spenser consents, but only after it is established that his beloved Susan Silverman will also be in attendance.<br><br> It should be a straightforward job for Spenser: show up for appearances, have some drinks, and spend some quality time with Susan. But when Spenser&#x2019;s old nemesis Rugar&#x2014;the Gray Man&#x2014;arrives, Spenser realizes that something is amiss. A storm, a kidnapping, and murder tear apart what should be a joyous occasion, and Rugar is seemingly at the center of it all. The only thing is that the sloppy kidnapping is not Rugar&#x2019;s style&#x2014;as Spenser knows from past encounters. With six dead bodies and more questions than he can process, Spenser begins a search for answers&#x2014;and the Gray Man.<br><br> With its razor-sharp dialogue, crisply etched characters, and high-wire narrative tension, <i>Rough Weather</i> once again proves that &#x201c;Robert B. Parker is a force of nature&#x201d; (<i>The Boston Globe</i>).</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Parker&#39;s Boston-based PI, Spenser, is hired as a bodyguard for a socialite who is hosting her daughter&#39;s wedding on her private island. When the groom is murdered and the bride is kidnapped, Spenser is determined to get to the bottom of the suspicious circumstances--especially the appearance of the Gray Man. Joe Mantegna&#39;s characterization of Spenser is as rock-steady as Spenser&#39;s integrity. Mantegna IS Spenser: determined and erudite, equally capable of killing a foe and cooking a gourmet meal. The dialogue, sometimes lacking the concise perfection that is Parker&#39;s hallmark, is rescued by Mantegna&#39;s portrayals of the characters, Spenser himself, Susan (elegantly cultured but remarkably tolerant of Spenser&#39;s life-and-death world), and Hawk (ever stalwart and loyal). Thanks to Mantegna&#39;s skill, this audiobook is better than the print publication.

The diagnosis was the first step of a long journey, physically painful for Shepherd and emotionally wrenching for Susannah and her family. But they pressed on, and using a combination of traditional and complementary medicine they beat the disease, and the odds.<br><br> Meadows chronicles her own story, and takes you into the lives of other remarkable people, exploring their heartbreaks and triumphs. One boy who has severe food allergies undergoes an unconventional therapy and is soon eating everything. An organic farmer in Washington State tries to solve the puzzle of her daughter&#x2019;s epileptic seizures. A physician with MS creates her own combination of treatments and goes from a wheelchair to riding a bike again. A child diagnosed with ADHD refuses to take medication and instead improves his life, and the life of his family, after changing his diet. Other families take on rheumatoid arthritis and autistic behaviors.<br><br> Meadows includes new information about traditional and nontraditional medicine and the latest science on how the health of our gut bacteria is connected to wellness&#x2014;and how the right foods play a key role in helping this microscopic population thrive.

But when we got to the field the next day, Shepherd&#x2019;s enthusiasm evaporated. While Beau and the other kids zigzagged around the cones, Shepherd stood still and looked bewildered. When it was his turn to kick the ball, he seemed lost. After fifteen minutes, he walked off the field and sat down in my lap, saying he was too tired to play. We watched the other kids, and I pointed out to him the drills I thought he might enjoy, the ones that Beau was charging through.

Faint enough&#x2014;�though it seems incredible now&#x2014;�that we didn&#x2019;t connect it to his reluctance on the field.<br><br>I assumed that Shepherd would warm to his soccer lessons the next time around. He and Beau still donned their jerseys at bedtime and talked each night about &#x201c;soccer school&#x201d; at the dinner table. But the following Saturday, Shepherd broke into tears the moment he started to run.<br><br>That week we saw our pediatrician, who referred us to an orthopedist. When no injury showed up on the X-�ray, the doctor said that arthritis was most likely the issue. Arthritis in a three-�year-�old? It sounded more odd than alarming at first, but over the next few weeks, as we waited to see the next specialist, we watched Shepherd spend more and more time on the couch. His stiff-�legged walk became more pronounced, though he claimed that it was just an imitation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a penguin,&#x201d; he would say. Then he started having trouble getting out of bed.<br><br>A month after our first appointment, we went to see Dr. Philip Kahn, a pediatric rheumatologist at NYU Langone Medical Center, who gave Shepherd a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.<br><br>JIA is an autoimmune disease. It causes painful swelling in the joints. It can lead to stunted growth, disability, and, rarely, blindness.<br><br>When Dr. Kahn tested his joints, Shepherd denied that it hurt even as he teared up in pain. Our son was stoic, Dr. Kahn said, as the kids he treated often were. Shepherd turned out to have arthritis in both knees and both wrists, as well as in his left shoulder and elbow. Many months later a particular memory came back to me, its attendant mother&#x2019;s guilt harsh despite the passage of time: We&#x2019;d bribed him to go to that last practice with the promise of ice cream.<br><br>Before driving home from the appointment, all four of us stopped for lunch at a hummus place that Dr. Kahn had recommended. We sat outside on the sidewalk, and Darin and I pretended that we were celebrating. This is great news, we told Shepherd. Now that we know what&#x2019;s wrong, you can take medicine that will make you feel better. Darin remembered thinking that we were lying to him, but he was trying to be more optimistic than he felt, for Shepherd&#x2019;s sake and for mine. Shepherd barely ate his lunch.<br><br>When we got home, I called my sister, Rae. She already knew that overwhelmed feeling of getting a child&#x2019;s diagnosis; she&#x2019;d been through it with her daughter, who had severe asthma and fourteen food allergies. Rae talked about how that moment when you receive a diagnosis like this, for your child, eclipses everything. She tried to reassure me that if an illness isn&#x2019;t life-�threatening, the fear eventually dies down, and coping with it becomes routine. Her daughter was three, the same age as Shepherd.<br><br>Rae must have made a similar call to me when she first got the allergy news about her daughter a couple of years before, but I have no memory of it. I&#x2019;m sure I was sympathetic. I knew that having a child with allergies was difficult and scary, of course. But it was only after we found out about Shepherd&#x2019;s JIA, maybe not that first day, but sometime in the weeks afterward, that I realized I&#x2019;d really had no idea before about what she was dealing with as a mother. I called her and told her I was sorry. Partly because I hadn&#x2019;t fully understood it, even though I don&#x2019;t think I could have. I don&#x2019;t think anyone can. But I also wanted to tell her I was sorry for what she went through because I knew now how much there was to be sorry for.<br><br>That day of Shepherd&#x2019;s diagnosis, Rae mentioned that a friend of her sister-�in-�law, a woman named Char Walker (short for Charlotte), sent her son&#x2019;s arthritis into remission with alternative medicine. Did I want to talk to her? I told Rae that I didn&#x2019;t, that we liked Dr. Kahn and wanted to follow his advice for now. We were starting Shepherd on a course of naproxen, a relative of the nonsteroidal anti-�inflammatory ibuprofen. We didn&#x2019;t want to mess around with something that might not work when conventional treatments were known to be effective. What I thought that day but didn&#x2019;t say to Rae was, We don&#x2019;t want to waste time talking to a kook.<br><br>Shepherd&#x2019;s arthritis spread while he was taking the naproxen. Joints in his fingers ballooned, and he developed nodules on his knuckles, which were suggestive of serious rheumatic disease. He started wetting his pants more frequently because, we realized after too much time, his fingers hurt so much that he couldn&#x2019;t pull his pants down.<br><br>We went back to Dr. Kahn, who said it was time to confront the painful inflammation in Shepherd&#x2019;s joints with methotrexate, a commonly used treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis.<br><br>Inflammation is supposed to be our friend. The heat, swelling, redness, and pain we&#x2019;re all familiar with are usually signs that this important immune system function is doing its job of fighting off an infection or helping us recover from an injury. Many different immune cells take part in inflammation. Some induce pain, perhaps to force us to rest and heal. Others&#x2014;�our white blood cells&#x2014;�attack bacteria or other foreign matter directly by gobbling them up. Inflammation can be incredibly destructive&#x2014;�that&#x2019;s how it defends us from invaders so effectively. But sometimes our immune system goes haywire and starts striking innocent tissue. When inflammation is inappropriate in this way or doesn&#x2019;t know when to stop, it becomes our enemy.<br><br>This is autoimmune disease: immune cells fighting against oneself. Excessive inflammation can also increase our risk of cancer and is a factor in many other diseases including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.<br><br>Methotrexate works by suppressing the immune system, which mistakenly attacks the joints of children with JIA. In significantly higher doses, methotrexate is used as chemotherapy. Even at the dose Shepherd would be getting, a minuscule fraction of that, methotrexate could still cause nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. The list of more serious possible side effects was terrifying to me&#x2014;�including liver damage and increased risk of lymphoma&#x2014;�even though Dr. Kahn told us that those risks were practically nonexistent.<br><br>Shepherd had polyarticular JIA&#x2014;�meaning five or more joints were affected. Children with this kind of arthritis are unlikely ever to outgrow it; Shepherd would probably be on medication for life. What were the long-�term effects of taking this drug on three-�year-�olds? This question tended to visit me in the middle of the night, when Dr. Kahn&#x2019;s reassurances that methotrexate was safe gave the least amount of comfort.<br><br>As my anxiety about the medication churned, I talked to my friend Andrea about it. She&#x2019;s a doctor. I knew what she would say, and I needed to hear it. She told me, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you have a choice.&#x201d; Somehow, as I suspected it would, hearing that the decision to give Shepherd methotrexate was out of my hands brought some relief. Though the effect was fleeting, for the time being at least, I couldn&#x2019;t worry about what I couldn&#x2019;t control.<br><br>The pills were orange, Shepherd&#x2019;s favorite color. When I first gave them to him, he was enthusiastic about taking them. The real coup: His twin brother, Beau, didn&#x2019;t get to have them. But watching my son gulp the pills down defeated me. It reinforced an image of Shepherd as sick, forever dependent on a drug I felt afraid of, however unreasonable his doctor might tell me that fear was.<br><br>But this was our only choice.<br><br>Unless it wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>One morning, while the boys were at preschool and Darin was out of the house, I decided to call Char Walker. She answered the phone, and within minutes I was crying to this woman I had never met. It was my first experience with the healthcare underground, women and families supporting each other, offering possible leads and kindness when traditional medicine wasn&#x2019;t enough.<br><br>Char told me that when her son Shane was an infant, only a month old, he started waking up seven or eight times a night screaming and crying, which he continued to do for a year and a half. He didn&#x2019;t have any symptoms that she could see. What was wrong? Soon she was crying every night, too. And then, at around eighteen months, he learned to talk and told her what hurt: his leg, his hip, and his wrist. Once they had the diagnosis of JIA, Char realized her son had probably been in pain every night of his life.<br><br>Char was a social worker and massage therapist who worked with cancer patients at NorthShore University HealthSystem outside Chicago. When Shane&#x2019;s rheumatologist presented methotrexate or steroid injections as the only options, Char was horrified.<br><br>Because she worked in the integrative medicine department, which combined Western medicine with complementary interventions developed outside the mainstream, she knew there were other things to try in order to combat inflammation. And she wanted to try them first.<br><br>Char told me that Shane&#x2019;s rheumatologist disapproved of her decision to delay drug therapy. Char said, &#x201c;It was like, &#x2018;What the hell are you doing, lady?&#x2019; &#x201d; She remembered the doctor telling her, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s going to work. I&#x2019;ve been doing this a long time.&#x201d; Char said the doctor warned her that she risked stunting her son&#x2019;s growth and damaging his joints, not to mention prolonging his pain. (Shane&#x2019;s rheumatologist declined to speak to me on the record, though she had Char&#x2019;s permission to do so.)<br><br>Char dug into medical literature databases. From a naturopath she learned about an anti-�inflammatory Chinese concoction called four marvels powder, which is made from two roots, a seed, and the bark from a decorative tree. Naturopathic medicine combines healing practices developed hundreds of years ago with more modern primary care. Emphasizing stress reduction, nutrition, and herbal supplements, among other interventions, the idea is to optimize the health of the body as a bulwark against disease.<br><br>Char also sought guidance from her colleague Dr. Leslie Mendoza Temple, the medical director of NorthShore&#x2019;s integrative medicine program. Dr. Mendoza Temple had experience with treating inflammatory arthritis. Char had come up with an extensive diet and supplement regimen. While wary of the risks, Dr. Mendoza Temple was comfortable giving the program a three-�month trial. &#x201c;I tried everything that I knew was safe to see what would work,&#x201d; Char told me.<br><br>I grabbed my pen and paper and started taking notes. No gluten, the protein in wheat, barley, and rye. No dairy. No refined sugar. No nightshades&#x2014;�a group of plants that includes potatoes and tomatoes&#x2014;�which are thought by some to be pro-�inflammatory, as is sugar. Every day, Shane took a probiotic, those supplements of bacteria that are either the same or similar to the microorganisms found naturally in the body. Plus two tablespoons of sour Montmorency cherry juice and at least 2,000 milligrams of omega-�3 fatty acids from fish oil, for their anti-�inflammatory properties. Instead of naproxen, Shane took a combination of ibuprofen and Tylenol to lower his overall intake of nonsteroidal anti-�inflammatories, which can be hard on the gut. And a quarter teaspoon, daily, of the Chinese herbal medicine called four marvels powder.<br><br>Char said she believed that her son&#x2019;s arthritis was caused by something I had never heard of before&#x2014;�leaky gut syndrome, a concept that had been accepted in alternative circles for years despite a name that asks you not to take it seriously. Leaky gut is based on the idea that inflammation in the gut damages the intestinal walls. As a result, the normally tight junctions between the cells that make up the intestinal wall&#x2019;s lining loosen. Then, like a careless bouncer, the barrier starts letting through undesirables, various proteins or bacteria that would normally be turned away. Once they&#x2019;ve breached the wall, the hypothesis goes, these materials make their way into the surrounding tissues where they don&#x2019;t belong. These uninvited guests set off the immune system, which mounts a defensive, inflammatory reaction to get rid of them. The problem is that, in this scenario, instigators keep coming through. So rather than wage a quick and dirty fight that limits destruction, the inflammation is dragged into a sustained, drawn-�out war.</p><h2>Women of the Civil War Through Primary Sources</h2><p>The Civil War was fought mostly by men, but the war could not have been won without the courageous effort of women.

Unlike his undead brethren <i>Dracula</i> and <i>Lestat</i>, Saint-Germain values life, and he is the very paradigm of humanity and tenderness. <p>In his long and sometimes overwhelmingly lonely life, Ragoczy has lived through France's 14th-century Black Plague (<i>Blood Roses</i>), Ivan the Terrible's bloody reign (<i>Darker Jewels</i>), and the First World War (<i>Writ in Blood</i>). In <i>Communion Blood</i>, Count Saint-Germain travels from Transylvania to Rome to help out a distressed friend. It is the 17th century, a time when the pope had absolute power, and his "Little House," (The Inquisition), was a law unto itself. A vampire would be viewed as the ultimate heretic, but Saint-Germain puts his own fears aside as he offers legal advice and support to his good friend and fellow undead Niklos Aulirios, who is involved in a bitter legal dispute. </p><p>For over 1,300 years, Niklos was the faithful manservant of Olivia Clemens, until she died the True Death. Although she bequeathed everything to Niklos in her will, a young German, Ahrent Julius Rothofen, has challenged the will. He claims to be a relative of Olivia's late husband, but the vampires know this "husband" was purely fictitious. Rothofen also happens to be part of Archbishop Siegfried Walmund's entourage, a powerful allegiance of men who use the church to further their political ambitions and personal wealth. These are not men to vex, particularly if one happens to be a vampire.</p><p> As she has done so well throughout her series, Yarbro weaves Saint-Germain's personal dramas into a larger historical picture. We learn much about the complicated politics and religious divisions of 17th-century Europe, and we are treated to a fascinating snapshot of the music, arts, and fashions of the era. This is all laced with enough horror, supernatural intrigue, and erotic vampire sex to remind us that Saint-Germain, despite his humanity, is really not of the natural world. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><b>Chelsea Quinn Yarbro</b>'s interests range from music--she composes and has studied seven different instruments as well as voice--to history, from horseback riding to needlepoint.

As soon as we have more of this, we want still more of it and more of that... and that.

His carefully composed pictures of elegant women fuse implicit sensuality, gorgeous color and fantastic juxtapositions. Leighton, elected president of London's Royal Academy in 1878, trained in Florence, Berlin, Rome, Frankfurt and Paris, and by synthesizing diverse influences?Pre-Raphaelites, Venetian masters, the German Nazarene school, French classicism, etc.?he reimagined Greek mythology and the ancient world in boldly dramatic works suffused with mystery. His output includes pencil and silverpoint studies of flowers and plants, seascapes awash in elemental power, strikingly evocative portraits and naturalistic travel paintings full of exotic charm. The catalogue of an exhibition at the Royal Academy, this beautifully illustrated, full-scale reassessment, featuring essays by British art historians, should help dispel the facile stereotype of Leighton as the archetypal academic artist. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lush, sensual figures clothed in draperies, mythical tales, exotic locales, narrative paintings, and more are part of this catalog, published for the centenary exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London earlier this year. Much more than a catalog of works, however, this volume is also a scholarly exposition of the role played in the Victorian art world by this most intriguing and accomplished man. Skillful prose explores the mind and the methods behind the works. The individual entries are splendid examples of their kind, and the illustrations superbly capture the depth of color and shadow. The subject matter and style of this fascinating study may not fit current taste, but the sensibility and depth, the color and form never fail to capture the imagination of the viewer.

But what about Sylvia Plath's trying to drown herself? After she strings herself up and before she swallows pills? To tell you the truth, I don't think I looked at that part.</p><p>To tell you the truth, I must have skipped a lot of parts in that book, maybe even the whole thing, because, let's see, for starters, it takes place in New York.</p><p>Nevertheless: Sylvia Plath finally did get to go to Europe. She studied at Cambridge University in England, and years after I read her book -- or rather, some of her book -- so did I. While I was there, a collection of Plath's letters to her mother was published, which my mother read and wrote to me about. "Why can't you write letters to me like that?" she asked. "They're so warm and loving."</p><p>When I finally read the letters, long after I'd left Cambridge, I discovered that my mother was right. Sylvia Plath's letters <i>were</i> warm and loving. "Your mother is always right," my grandmother once told me, "although I have never liked the yellow table in her center hall." My grandmother also told me that she -- my grandmother -- believes everyone has a determined number of footsteps to use up in a lifetime, and, therefore, it is foolhardy to exercise since you will only exhaust your quota sooner and die.</p><p>Let me give you the gist of a typical Plath letter: "My dearest of Mothers, I met the most marvelous man at the Trinity May Ball, where I wore an ice blue gown that was simply divine. Tomorrow, tea with the Queen! I love you!"</p><p>I, too, had met a pretty marvelous man in England, though none of my letters home mentioned him. Let me give you the gist of one of those letters: "It's so cold here. And if you like the weather, you'll <i>LOVE</i> the food. Do you remember what I'm supposed to be writing my thesis about? I have to hand a chapter in, but I can't remember what my topic is. I think I wrote the title in a postcard I wrote to you a couple of months ago. The bursar's office says they never received your check."</p><p>Sylvia Plath and I had one thing in common besides our outfits for socializing with the Queen -- mine being a never-worn, never-to-be-worn drab long skirt; and hers, well, to be honest, I can't actually say if she had an ice blue gown or ever met the Queen. As I told you, I was giving you the gist. In any case, Sylvia and I were alike in that both of us had a habit of shielding our mothers, and in my case, my father, too, from what was really going on in our respective lives. You know, of course, about Sylvia's despair and the conclusive oven thing. Even her mother knows now. But I don't think you know very much about me.</p><p>An only child, I was born in the suburbs of Philadelphia, a town called Abington. My ancestors were -- no, don't worry. I won't tell you <i>everything.</i> I'll start when he knocked on my door.</p><p>The marvelous man was wearing a rugby shirt and jeans and sneakers and he looked boyish, I thought, for someone from another generation.</p><p>"You don't look twenty-eight," I said. I was twenty-one.</p><p>"You can count the rings," he said.</p><p>"You're married?" I said. He laughed.</p><p>"I meant tree rings," he said. "It was a joke about dendrochronology."</p><p>"Oh," I said. "I never get dendrochronological jokes."</p><p>He told me that he'd arrived from New York that morning, that he was going to be a teaching fellow in philosophy, that he'd recently been at Princeton, where he studied with someone famous I pretended to have heard of, that he'd taken a year off to join VISTA and eradicate poverty in Scarsdale (did I really hear him say Scarsdale?), and that a friend of mine had suggested he look me up -- he'd dated one of her roommates, who'd run off to an ashram in India after he broke up with her. She still wrote to him, though the motif, he said, was mainly gastrointestinal.</p><p>Those were the days when a person with a knapsack might knock on your door, say he was a friend of a friend of a cousin of an ex-girlfriend of a guy he had hiked with in Australia, and you then invited this person to sleep on your sofa and eat your food for as long as he felt like it. It was well within your guest's rights to take or break one of your cherished possessions, and unacceptable for you to care because that would be materialistic. Hitchhiking through Europe a year or so before, I had pulled that stunt in Amsterdam and ended up living for a week with someone who'd been a medical student for the last twelve years, during which time he'd saved the rind of every tangerine he'd eaten. Thousands of dried rinds, each a perfect half sphere, were stacked throughout the apartment. Toward the end of my stay, the rinds nearly burned to a crisp when I stood too close to the fireplace and my cheap pants burst into flame.</p><p>But Eugene Obello was only wondering if I'd like to go for a walk with him. Right now. Those were also the days before date books and plans and pretending you had something else to do in order to look popular. So I said yes.</p><p>While Eugene was in the bathroom, I took one of my smart-looking social theory books from my bookshelf and positioned it in a conspicuous spot. How far I had come from Abington High. "Remember Abington," the principal used to announce every morning over the PA. "First in the alphabet, first in achievement, and first in attitude!" We might have been first in the alphabet, but the other two...iffy.</p><p>And look at me now: Cambridge University! Abington was a large bland redbrick public high school built in the 1950s. This place was a dominion of majesty established in the thirteenth century by King Henry III. "I'm living like royalty," I wrote to my parents when I arrived. "Could you please send me my down quilt?"</p><p>Grungy-looking students hung out all day in the college bar, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and drinking ale. Another clique modeled itself on the Bloomsbury group -- someone dressed and talked like Virginia Woolf, another like Clive Bell, another like Duncan Grant, and so on. There were some actual descendants of the Bloomsbury group at the college, but the look-alikes would have nothing to do with them, regarding them as poseurs. Even the student council was something to write home about: they issued a statement coming out against political, economic, and legal discrimination, which they happened to "deplore."</p><p>On the other hand, the school was still mostly made up of upper-class males, the first females having been accepted only a few years earlier. Some of the upper-class males belonged to a society whose sole function, so far as I could make out, was to break into the room of a first-year student, interfere with it, and leave a check for damages done. Then they peed in the fountain -- the one topped by a statue of Henry VI with the symbolic figures of Learning and Religion seated below.</p><p>So: the splendid architecture, the adorable boys' choir, the fields of daffodils...you get it. "They even have grazing cows on the lawns. How inspirational!" I wrote to my parents. "And I heard that only the students in MY college are allowed to shoot and eat the swans that swim on the Cam." In a P.S., I added, "I <i>NEED</i> money to go to Wales. Maybe you could sell my charm bracelet -- the one you gave me for my Sweet Sixteen? It's just a worldly object. Also, could you send me some hangers?"</p><p>That entire first year, gosh, I was happy. I was a foreigner! I'd never been to Europe and now here I was, in a country where everyone sounded like Winston Churchill or Mary Poppins; where all the women had flawless skin and all the men looked as if they'd been wandering around in the Underground since World War II, never having seen the light of day or another change of clothes. Every aspect of life in England seemed a notch from normal. Which made even the mundane exotic and exhilarating.

"If it's not too rude to ask," he said, "bearing in mind I met you only a few minutes ago, and I hope I'm not entering some kind of kinky area here, or maybe I do" -- Eugene smiled, I didn't -- "but what are all those buckets and funnels doing in your bathtub?"

Because my next-door neighbor, Obax Geeddi Abtidoon, a rich and beautiful Somalian who wanted to be a chef but was getting her degree in polar studies when she wasn't cooking curry and making sliced carrot salad for everyone on the floor, had given me the ginger beer starter and how could I be so rude as to throw it out?</p><p>Eugene sat on the only chair. His way of sitting there was so relaxed it put me on edge.

Inventors promised we&#x2019;d all be flying with them now, enabling us to zoom around effortlessly in the sky and getting us&nbsp;to work without traffic jams and trains. What happened to the jet pack?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>The Great American Jet Pack</i>,<i> </i>Steve Lehto gives us the definitive history of this and related devices, explaining how the technology arose, how it works, and why we don&#x2019;t have them in our garages today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These individual lift devices, as they were blandly labeled by the government men who financed much of their development, answered man&#x2019;s desire to simply step outside and take flight. No runways, no wings, no pilot&#x2019;s license were required. Soaring through the air with the wind in your face and landing anyplace there was room to stand&#x2014;could this be done?&nbsp;Yes, it could be, and it was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the jet pack was perhaps the most overpromised technology of all time. From the rocket belt to the jet belt to the flying platform and all the way to Yves Rossy&#x2019;s 21st-century free flights using a jet-powered wing, this book profiles the inventors and pilots, the hucksters and cheats, the businessmen and soldiers who were involved with these machines. And it finally tells a great American story of a technology whose promise may, one day, yet come to fruition.</p></p><p><b>Steve Lehto</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>Death&#x2019;s Door: The Truth Behind Michigan&#x2019;s Largest Mass Murder</i>, a&nbsp;2007 Michigan Notable Book; <i>Chrysler's Turbine Car</i>; and <i>Michigan&#x2019;s Columbus: The Life of Douglass Houghton</i>.Gilligan flew one on the island. So did James Bond, fleeing from some baddies. So did Professor John Robinson, while he was lost in space. First thought up by sf writers back in the 1920s and turned into reality in the mid&#x2013;1960s, the jet pack was the latest in a long line of personal flying devices that included flying shoes, wearable rockets, and a flying platform. It almost immediately entered the public consciousness, becoming a sort of pop-culture icon, the device that was going to completely change the way people got from place to place. It hasn&#x2019;t yet, but as Lehto says, the story of the jet pack&#x2014;of, indeed, the quest for the perfect personal lift device&#x2014;is really part of the larger story of &#x201c;man&#x2019;s dream of flying.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a fascinating tale, full of wild ideas and serious science (with, yes, a little kidnapping, torture, and murder), and Lehto tells it very well, focusing on the people for whom creating a functional small-scale flying machine was not just a puzzle to be solved but a calling. --David Pitt</p><h2>Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting</h2><p><br><p>This book is the first comprehensive, scientifically based study of the nature and impact of intangibles.

In EI the children are three- to five-years-old.&nbsp; Many people say to me, &#x201c;How could children so young require the services of a psychologist?&#x201d;&nbsp; My response is, &#x201c;If you knew how many children were being kicked out of preschool, you would be amazed and hopefully appalled&#x201d; but that is a different book.&nbsp; In this one I want to describe my efforts toward an undivided life, integrating my professional and spiritual lives.</p><p>My faith requires of me:&nbsp; radical honesty, truth-telling, and a principled life. My employer required of me:&nbsp; relative pragmatic legalism. Those often conflict. I will share a bit about a case to illustrate.</p><p>I did a re-evaluation for Willard, a child in our autism support program.&nbsp; His teacher was concerned because he did not seem to be a child with autism.&nbsp; Since I was the psychologist covering that classroom, I did the re-evaluation.&nbsp; Not imagining that the parent would be unhappy about finding out their child did not have autism, I proceeded in the usual routine way.&nbsp; Suddenly mid-stream I learned that the parent had put in a complaint that the autism diagnosis was being removed.&nbsp; Nothing prepared me for the moment when I discovered a mother who was upset to find that her child did not have autism.</p><p>Then I discovered that this was not the first complaint the mother had made.&nbsp; In the child&#x2019;s initial evaluation, he was found not to have autism, even though a developmental pediatrician had diagnosed him.&nbsp; But, unwilling to fight with a parent, my bosses had determined the best course of action was to give the child the diagnosis as a mediation concession.</p><p>My boss was not willing to fight with her because it would be very expensive and we would lose.&nbsp; I was not given a choice in the matter. Twice, a child was given the diagnosis of autism as a mediation concession.</p><p>I have been radically honest despite the risks; Willard and I lose to pragmatic legalism in education. I pray hard for that child and all the many children I have encountered in recent years whose parents need them to be sicker than they are.&nbsp; This is just one of many kinds of situation in which nothing in my experience or training had prepared me. In my initial years as a psychologist, the role of administrators was more supportive of children and psychologists; something changed along the years. Administrators whose first priority is not what is best for children but what is legally pragmatic was another set of situations I was not prepared for by training or experience.</p><p>In my depths, I know that our souls need to be seen; and we need to be heard.&nbsp; Only by listening deeply to the children can we hear their pain.&nbsp; Only by listening deeply can we know that their behavior is about their deepest needs not being met; at this age, it is not usually about defying the adults around them, as many teachers and parents believe.&nbsp; Most children cannot get that far.&nbsp; Most cannot get beyond the deep needs to be seen and heard for the people they are, to be affirmed and loved just as they are, despite the adult&#x2019;s needs to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; them, to label them as sick, or to reject or abandon them.</p><p><strong>This book represents a sampling of the results of that experiment with heart- and soul-centered practice.&nbsp; I now view heart-and soul-centered practice along with strength-based approaches as the hope for the future of our children and for the education systems that are now failing them.</strong></p></p><p>Jennifer Elam is a Friend and a licensed psychologist who has studied Quaker spirituality and the lives of the Christian contemplatives and mystics.

Are they satisfying or empty? Are they superficial or deep? Do we generally get along with people, or is there a trail of conflict in our past? Should we get along with Everyone? Does it matter? More importantly, do our relationships matter to God? Does He care when a husband and wife turn their backs on each other? When children sob in their bedrooms? When parents lie sleepless at night because of wayward children? When teenagers stomp out of the house? When in-laws feel left out? Does it matter to God when church business meetings get tense? Is He concerned about how we talk to each other in the body of Christ? Or how we talk ABOUT each other? God&#39;s Word says how we get along with one another matters very much to God. And His Word includes instructions telling us how to build relationships and how to resolve problems. Inspirational and practical, Getting Along With People God&#39;s Way points us to the life and teachings of Jesus who modeled perfectly the way of peace. Following Him, we have what we need to restore, build, and maintain healthy relationships.</p><p></p><h2>Organizing Your Craft Space</h2><p>Every crafter wants a work space that&#39;s usable, attractive, and well-organised, and here&#39;s how to achieve that goal.

Joaquin Miller Beauty and majesty have drawn people to the slopes of Mount Shasta for centuries. Long revered as sacred by the Native American tribes in its region, it remains important to various spiritual communities. Modern-day Native American rituals take place there, and elements of other religious practices such as a Buddhist monastery have also clustered around the mountain. Artists too have flocked to Mount Shasta. Writers and painters alike have sought to capture the wonderment we feel at the sight of the lone mountain towering at the head of a long valley. Sudden and Solitary presents over 150 years of artwork, ranging from the artists who accompanied Wilkes, Fremont, and other early explorers to Albert Bierstadt and William Keith to the many visionary artists, past and present, big and small, who have been inspired by Mount Shasta. This book is, as the authors state in the introduction, an attempt to characterize what Mount Shasta meant to the nineteenth-century American and Californian, and how those ideas have evolved in the visual arts up to the present. There are many mountains in the West, but few offer the experience that Shasta does of being in a place apart and unique; it is no surprise that it has generated an artistic legacy of such grandeur. The artwork in this book will be shown at an exhibition at the Turtle Bay Exploration Park in summer and fall 2008.</p><p>An art and rare book dealer, art publisher, and lecturer, William C.

O&#x2019;Rourke on a global fun-finding mission to the most desperate places on the planet, from the bombed-out streets of Beirut to the stultifying blandness of Heritage USA. P.J.&#x2019;s unforgettable adventures abroad include storming student protesters&#x2019; barricades in South Korea, interviewing Communist insurrectionists in the Philippines, and going undercover in Arab garb at Jerusalem&#x2019;s Dome of the Rock Mosque. Packed with P.J.&#x2019;s classic riffs on everything from Polish nightlife under communism to Third World driving tips, Holidays in Hell is one of the best-loved books by one of today&#x2019;s most celebrated humorists &#x2015; a full-tilt, no-holds-barred romp through politics, culture, and ideology. &#x201c;This is funny, outrageous, perceptive stuff, written with brio.&#x201d; &#x2015;The Washington Post Book World &#x201c;O&#x2019;Rourke. . . seems to have teethed on brass knuckles and suckled on bile. He is also one of the funniest writers in America, or wherever else he may go to satisfy his desperate need to extract humor from folly and chaos.&#x201d; &#x2015;Time &#x201c;To say that P. J. O&#x2019;Rourke is funny is like saying that the Rocky Mountains are scenic &#x2015; accurate but insufficient. At best he&#x2019;s downright exhilarating.&#x201d; &#x2015; Chicago Tribune</p><p>No doubt about it: P. J. O'Rourke has a bizarre sense of fun. "What I've ... been," he writes in his introduction to <i>Holidays in Hell</i> "is a Trouble Tourist--going to see insurrections, stupidities, political crises, civil disturbances and other human folly because ... because it's fun." Forget Hawaii or the Poconos--O'Rourke gets his jollies in places like war-torn Lebanon where he is greeted at the border by a gun barrel in his face, or Seoul, just in time for election-day violence. Wherever he goes, however, O'Rourke takes his quirky sense of humor, laser eye for detail, and artful way with words: a Philippine army officer is "powerful-looking in a short, compressed way, like an attack hamster," and the Syrian army is described as having "dozens of silly hats, mostly berets in yellow, orange and shocking pink, but also tiny pillbox chapeaux.... The paratroopers wear shiny gold jumpsuits and crack commando units have skin-tight fatigues in a camouflage pattern of violet, peach, flesh tone and vermilion on a background of vivid purple. This must give excellent protective coloration in, say, a room full of Palm Beach divorcees in Lily Pulitzer dresses." <p> O'Rourke's flip, sarcastic style isn't for everyone, of course; the concept that anyone could find sightseeing in the Beirut or El Salvador of the 1980s <i>fun</i> might prove offensive to more than a few readers right off the bat. But love him or hate him, P. J. O'Rourke knows how to tell a good story, and if you like your travel writing laced with more than a little cynicism, <i>Holidays in Hell</i> could be just the book you've been looking for.</p>Travels to hellholes around the globe looking for trouble--from Lebanon to Epcot-- the truth and a good time.</p><h2>Family Sabbatical (Nancy Pearl&#39;s Book Crush Rediscoveries)</h2><p><p><b>The Ridgeway family takes on France in this delightful story from Newbery Medal winner Carol Ryrie Brink.</b></p><p>Professor Ridgeway is on sabbatical in the South of France&#x2014;and the whole family is along for the adventure.

The <em>Flora </em>represented the life work of botanist Jacob Peter Anderson who's aim was to produce a flora encompassing all known vascular plants in the state. Included are keys and descriptions for each family, genus and species; small line-drawings are provided for diagnostic features of many of the plants included in the book. Long out-of-print and now somewhat dated in terms of what is now known of the Alaskan flora and species taxonomy, <em>Anderson's Flora </em>remains, however, a valuable resource for the study of Alaska's diverse plant life. Also, there is no field guide-sized reference useful for researchers, students, and others studying plants in the field. As the original book did not provide keys and descriptions to the important willow (<em>Salix</em>) genus, an addendum is provided with summer and winter keys to the willow species known from the Alaska interior. Author J. P. Anderson (1874-1953) resided in Alaska from 1913-1940, before leaving for a position at Iowa State University where he continued his work of preparing his <em>Flora, </em>including a number of return visits to Alaska for additional field research.</p></p><p></p><h2>Mera: Queen of Atlantis</h2><p><b>From the pages of <i>Aquaman</i> comes a brand-new adventure starring Mera, in her own title for the first time ever!</b><br><br>As the brutal Atlantean Civil War rages, Mera must keep the peace between the surface world and Atlantis as its newly anointed queen in exile.

The British magazine Mojo, among the most respected rock publications in the world, celebrates punk's 30th anniversary with this fully-illustrated volume, collecting archival articles and photos from the pages of Mojo, those of sister magazine Q and the now-defunct Sounds (punk's original champion). It therefore reads like a magazine, divided into three departments: "In the Beginning," "The Beginning of the End" and "What Happened Next." Taking readers inside seminal scenes, the book highlights the Pistols' first interview; Blondie's unlikely success; the rise of Black Flag; Sid Vicious' tragic demise; and Green Day's unexpected coming-of-age party at Woodstock '94. Special sections feature stunning black-and-white photography that often captures a moment more eloquently than the book's prose, and shorter pieces about fanzines, fashion and memorabilia add context. Most valuable to music collectors will be the book's list of top 20 British punk singles and what it proclaims as "the 77 greatest punk albums ever." Appropriately, the book closes with a two-page homage to the late Clash front man Joe Strummer, heralding him as "the heart of punk itself." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He plays that like I play guitar. As long as there's a smile on Rupert's face, I'm cool."</i>-Keith Richards on Prince Rupert Lowenstein??In </p><p>1968 Mick Jagger couldn't understand why the Rolling Stones were broke. The man he asked for help was a German prince, a merchant banker. They forged an unlikely alliance which re-invented the business of rock 'n' roll. As a youthquake shook the Establishment, Prince Rupert Loewenstein thrived in both worlds, never relinquishing his elegance or decorum. For nearly forty years Prince Rupert worked with the Stones as-in his own words-"a combination of bank manager, psychiatrist, and nanny," usually enthralled with his clients but often bemused and exasperated with them, too. Coolly impartial and dryly humorous, this is a refreshingly different take on the rock 'n' roll world from within its inner sanctum.</p></p><p>Born in Majorca in 1933, <b>Prince Rupert Lowenstein</b> was a stockbroker for the American firm Bache &amp; Co. before going on to form a consortium that bought the investment bank Leopold Joseph &amp; Sons. Five years later he met Mick Jagger and became accountant to the Rolling Stones, a position he held for the following thirty-seven years. Prince Rupert now lives in Richmond, London, with his wife Princess Josephine; they have three children.Loewenstein, former &#x201c;director of the merchant bank Leopold Joseph,&#x201d; met Mick Jagger in 1968. A Stones insider asked if he would be interested in &#x201c;taking care of the finances&#x201d; for the band. The band&#x2019;s name &#x201c;meant virtually nothing to&#x201d; Loewenstein, but he accepted the offer. In 1968, rock bands were not paid well by today&#x2019;s standards, even the Beatles and the Stones. The Stones&#x2019; recording contract with Decca was bad enough, but their rights to &#x201c;future earnings of the masters and copyrights&#x201d; had been sold to Allen Klein, who had bound the band to him by a &#x201c;bewildering mass of contracts.&#x201d; After extricating them from the nefarious clutches of Klein and Decca, &#x201c;Prince Rupert&#x201d; later prompted them to become tax exiles and, over the years, contributed much to making Rolling Stones Inc. one of the most profitable brands in the world.

No single event makes this more plain, Laurie Green argues, than the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers' strike, which culminated in the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Exploring the notion of "freedom" in postwar Memphis, Green demonstrates that the civil rights movement was battling an ongoing "plantation mentality" based on race, gender, and power that permeated southern culture long before--and even after--the groundbreaking legislation of the mid-1960s. <br><br>With its slogan "I AM a Man!" the Memphis strike provides a clarion example of how the movement fought for a black freedom that consisted of not only constitutional rights but also social and human rights. As the sharecropping system crumbled and migrants streamed to the cities during and after World War II, the struggle for black freedom touched all aspects of daily life. Green traces the movement to new locations, from protests against police brutality and racist movie censorship policies to innovations in mass culture, such as black-oriented radio stations. Incorporating scores of oral histories, Green demonstrates that the interplay of politics, culture, and consciousness is critical to truly understanding freedom and the black struggle for it.<br><br></p><p>"A deeply researched, comprehensive account of the many levels of struggle and modes of thought that African Americans in the Deep South employed to break the system of Jim Crow. . . . [A] powerful work of people's scholarship. . . . Provides a welcome, fresh look and brilliantly documents that varied terrain of the African American battle for personhood and dignity."-- <i>Journal of Southern History</i> <br>Exploring the notion of African American &#39;freedom&#39; in postwar Memphis, Green demonstrates that the civil rights movement was battling an ongoing &#39;plantation mentality&#39; based on race, gender, and power that permeated southern culture long before--and even after--the groundbreaking legislation of the mid-1960s.

She is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator. She lives in Oklahoma with her husband, artist Larry Dixon, and their flock of parrots. She can be found at mercedeslackey.com.No matter how comfortable he was, Skif slept like a cat, with one eye open and one ear cocked, in case trouble stole upon him, thinking to catch him unaware. So even though he didn&#x2019;t know <b>what</b> woke him, when he woke, he came alert all at once, and instead of jumping to his feet, he stayed frozen in place, listening.<p>Wood creaked slightly, somewhere in the loft. Was it a footstep? The sound came again, a trifle nearer, then fabric brushed against something harder. There was someone up here with him.</p><p>Now, it wouldn&#x2019;t be one of the laundry servants on proper business; they came up the stair, clumping and talking loudly. It <b>might</b> be a servant or a page come up here to nap or escape work&#x2014;if it was, although Skif would have a slight advantage in that the other wouldn&#x2019;t want to be caught, he had a profound dis-advantage in that he didn&#x2019;t belong here himself, and the other could legitimately claim to have heard something overhead and gone to investigate. If that was the case, he&#x2019;d be stuck under this tub until the other �person left.</p><p>It might also be something and someone entirely different&#x2014;a thief, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be found any more than Skif did, who might flee, or might fight, depending on the circumstances, if Skif came out of hiding.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t know enough yet; better to wait. It was highly unlikely that the other would choose Skif&#x2019;s particular tub to hide himself or anything else underneath. It was out of the way and smallish, and Skif had chosen it for precisely those reasons. Instead, he peered under the edge of it, as the surreptitious sounds moved closer, thanking his luck that it wasn&#x2019;t dusty up here. Now would be a bad time to sneeze.</p><p>It sounded, given the direction the sounds were coming from, as if the unknown had gotten into the loft the same way that Skif had, through the gable window at the end. Skif narrowed his eyes, waiting for something to come into his area of vision among the slats of the wooden tubs. The light was surprisingly good up here, but the sun was all wrong for Skif to see a shadow that might give him some notion of who the other intruder was. The creaking gave Skif a good idea that the fellow moved toward the stairs, which meant he was at least <i>thinking</i> of using them to descend into the laundry itself. That wasn&#x2019;t an option Skif would have chosen&#x2014;unless, of course, the fellow was a thief, and was planning on purloining something from the laundry itself. There was plenty of stuff to steal in there; silk handkerchiefs and scarves, the embroidered ribbons that the young ladies of the household liked to use for their necks and hair and the young men liked to give them, the gossamer veils they wore in public&#x2014;all light, easy to carry, presumably easy to sell. The only reason Skif hadn&#x2019;t helped himself before this was that he didn&#x2019;t know where to dispose of such things and was not about to share his loot with Kalchan.</p><p>A foot slid slowly into view; not a big foot, and most importantly of all, not a foot clad in the soled sock of a page or liveried indoor servant. This was a foot in a half-boot of very flexible black leather, laced tight to the ankle and calf, much worn and patched, not much larger than his own, attached to a leg in rusty black trews with worn places along the hem. This foot, and the person who wore those trews, did not belong here. No one in Lord Orthallen&#x2019;s service wore anything of the sort.</p><p>Skif made a quick decision, and struck. Before the other knew he was there, Skif&#x2019;s hand darted from under the tub, and Skif had the fellow&#x2019;s ankle held fast in a hand that was a lot stronger than it looked.</p><p>Skif had half expected a struggle, or at least an attempt to get free, but the owner of the ankle had more sense than that&#x2014;or was more afraid of the attention that the sounds of a struggle would bring than anything Skif could do to him. So now, it was the other&#x2019;s turn to freeze.</p><p>Skif mentally applauded his decision. He thought he had a good idea of what was going through the other fellow&#x2019;s mind. Now, the arm that Skif had snaked out from beneath the tub was clad in a sleeve that was more patch than whole cloth. So Skif obviously didn&#x2019;t belong here either, and the two of them were at an equal advantage and disadvantage. For either to make noise or fuss would mean that both would be caught&#x2014;and no point in trying to claim that one had seen the other sneak over the wall and followed to catch him either. An honest boy would have pounded on the back entrance to report the intruder, not climbed up after him. No, no&#x2014;if one betrayed the other, both of them would be thrown to the City Guard.</p><p>So the other fellow did the prudent thing; he stayed in place once Skif let go of him so that Skif could slip out from under the tub. Like it or not, for the moment they were partners in crime. Skif, however, had a plan.</p><p>There was a moment when the other <b>could</b> have tried to knock Skif out and make a run for it, but he didn&#x2019;t. Such an action would have been noisy, of course, and he still might have been caught, but with one unconscious or semiconscious boy on the floor to distract those who would come clambering up here, he might have been able to get away. Skif breathed a sigh of relief when he was all the way out from under the tub and was able to kneel next to it, looking up at the interloper.</p><p>What he saw was a boy of about fifteen, but small for his age, so that he wasn&#x2019;t a great deal taller than Skif. His thin face, as closed and impassive as any statue&#x2019;s, gave away no hint of what he was thinking. His eyes narrowed when he got a good look at his captor, but there was no telling what emotion lay behind the eyes.</p><p>His clothing was better than Skif&#x2019;s&#x2014;but then again, whose wasn&#x2019;t? Skif wore every shirt he owned&#x2014;three, all ragged, all inexpertly patched by his own hands, all faded into an indeterminate brown&#x2014;with a knitted tunic that was more hole than knit over the top of it all. His linen trews, patched as well, were under his woolen trews, which for a change, had been darned except for the seat which sported a huge patch made from an old canvas tent. This boy&#x2019;s clothing was at least all the same color and the patches were of the same sort of material as the original. In fact, unless you were as close as Skif was, you wouldn&#x2019;t notice the patches much.</p><p>He had long hair of a middling brown color, and a headband of dark braided string to keep it out of his eyes. His eyes matched his hair, and if he&#x2019;d been fed as well as one of the page boys his face would have been round; as it was, the bones showed clearly, though not nearly as sharply defined as Skif&#x2019;s.</p><p>There were other signs of relative prosperity; the other boy&#x2019;s wrists weren&#x2019;t as thin as Skif&#x2019;s, and he showed no signs of the many illnesses that the poor were prone to in the winter. If he was a thief&#x2014;and there was little doubt in Skif&#x2019;s mind that he was&#x2014;this boy was a good enough thief to be doing well.</p><p>The two of them stared at each other for several moments. It was the older boy who finally broke the silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Wot ye want?&#x201d; he asked, in a harsh whisper.</p><p>Until that moment when he&#x2019;d seized the other&#x2019;s ankle, Skif hadn&#x2019;t known what he wanted, but the moment his hand had touched leather, his plan had sprung up in his mind.</p><p>&#x201c;Teach me,&#x201d; he whispered, and saw with satisfaction the boy&#x2019;s eyes widen with surprise, then his slow nod.</p><p>He squatted down beside Skif, who beckoned to him to follow. On hands and knees, Skif led him into the maze of tubs and empty packing crates until they were hidden from view against the wall, next to the chimney.</p><p>There they settled, screened by stacks of buckets needing repair. From below came the steady sounds of the laundry, which should cover any conversation of theirs.</p><p>&#x201c;Ye ain&#x2019;t no page, an&#x2019; ye ain&#x2019;t got no reason t&#x2019;be in the wash house. Wot ye doin&#x2019; here?&#x201d; the boy asked, more curious than annoyed.</p><p>Skif shrugged. &#x201c;Same as you, only not so good,&#x201d; he replied. He explained his ruse to get fed to the boy, whose lips twitched into a thin smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Not bad done, fer a little,&#x201d; he acknowledged. &#x201c;Noboddie never pays mind t&#x2019;littles. Ye cud do better, though. Real work, not this pilferin&#x2019; bits uv grub. I kin get through places a mun can&#x2019;t, an ye kin get where I can&#x2019;t. We might cud work t&#x2019;gether.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I want ye t&#x2019;teach me,&#x201d; Skif whispered back. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t keep runnin&#x2019; this ferever. Won&#x2019; look like no page much longer.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy snorted. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t need to. Here, shake on&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He held out his hand, a thin, hard, and strong hand, and Skif took it, cementing their bargain with a shake. &#x201c;M&#x2019;name&#x2019;s Deek,&#x201d; the boy said, releasing his hand.</p><p>Skif was happy to note that Deek hadn&#x2019;t tried to crush his hand in his grip or otherwise show signs of being a bully. &#x201c;Call me Skif,&#x201d; he offered.</p><p>Deek grinned. &#x201c;Good. Now, you stay here&#x2014;I come back in a tick, an&#x2019; we&#x2019;ll scoot out by th&#x2019; back t&#x2019;gether.&#x201d; He cocked his head down at the floor, and it was pretty clear that there wasn&#x2019;t anyone working down in the laundry anymore. It was probably time for supper; the laundresses and some of the other servants ate long before their betters, and went to bed soon after sundown, for their work started before sunrise.</p><p>Skif nodded; he saw no reason to doubt that Deek would play him false, since he was sitting on the only good route of escape. He and Deek made their way back to Skif&#x2019;s tub; Skif ducked back inside, and Deek crept down the stairs into the laundry.</p><p>Deek came back up quickly, and the quick peek of silk from the now slightly-bulging breast of his tunic told Skif all he needed to know. As he had expected, Deek had managed to slip downstairs, purloin small items of valuable silk, and get back up without anyone catching sight of him. As long as he took small things, items unlikely to be missed for a while, that weren&#x2019;t such rare dainties as to be too recognizable, it was quite likely that the owners themselves would assume they&#x2019;d been mislaid. No specially embroidered handkerchiefs, for example, or unusual colors of veils. He beckoned to Skif, who followed him out over the roof, both of them lying as flat as stalking cats as they wiggled their way along the tiles, to minimize the chance of someone spotting them from below. From this position, they couldn&#x2019;t see much; just the lines of drying linens in the yard, the tops of bushes past the linens that marked the gardens, and the bulk of the magnificent mansion beyond. If anyone looked out of the windows of the mansion, they <b>would</b> be spotted.</p><p>Not likely though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--Reprinted from Take a Thief by Mercedes Lackey by permission of DAW, a member of Penguin Putnam Inc.

We want it. We need it. We pay it homage with songs and poems and great works of art. And when we lose it, there's no pain as intense or excruciating. For centuries we've been trying to figure it out, control it, or just get better at it. As the editor of a column about love for the <em>New York Times</em>, Daniel Jones reads thousands of stories about people's intimate relationships&#x2014;the ones that soar, crash, or hum along, from the bizarre to the supposedly &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; It's possible that he's read more true love stories than anyone on earth. In <em>Love Illuminated</em>, he teases apart this mystifying emotion that thrills, crushes, and sustains.</p><p>Drawing from the 50,000 stories that have crossed his desk over the past decade, Jones explores ten aspects of love&#x2014;pursuit, destiny, vulnerability, connection, trust, practicality, monotony, infidelity, loyalty, and wisdom&#x2014;and creates a lively, funny and enlightening journey through this universal human experience that jangles the head and stirs the heart.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Love is unrivaled in its power to thrill, crush, and sustain. No subject in human history has been more thoroughly examined. And yet, as desperately as we have tried to unlock love's mysteries&#x2014;to "decode" it through scientific experimentation, philosophical inquiry, and even mathematical algorithms&#x2014;do we really understand love any better today than Shakespeare did nearly five hundred years ago?</p><p>As the editor of a column about love in the <em>New York Times</em>, Daniel Jones has been privy to the deepest personal revelations of tens of thousands of strangers. Deluged with stories of scheming cheaters, hopeless romantics, racy texts, and fierce devotion, he has spent much of the past decade wading through love's muck and majesty&#x2014;and has taken plenty of notes along the way. In <em>Love Illuminated</em>, he uses his unique perspective to tease apart life's most mystifying subject.</p><p>Drawing from the 50,000 tales of love that have crossed his desk, Jones traces the arc of human relationships through ten phases, starting with the pursuit, destiny, vulnerability, connection, and trust of new love, and then turning to the practicality, monotony, infidelity, loyalty, and wisdom of love matured. With empathy and wry humor, he takes readers on an enlightening journey through the highs, lows, and enduring unknowns of this universal experience that rattles the head and stirs the heart.</p><p>As Jones explains, "Love is about curiosity, not certainty. It's about tossing oneself overboard into the wild seas, not remaining safely on deck."</p><p>In <em>Love Illuminated</em>, he pulls us into the depths of love in all its contradictions and complexities, offering glimmers of understanding along with the comforts of shared experience.</p><p>Daniel Jones has edited the Modern Love column in the Sunday Styles section of the <em>New York Times</em> since its inception in October 2004. His books include two essay anthologies, <em>Modern Love</em> and <em>The Bastard on the Couch</em>, and a novel, <em>After Lucy</em>, which was a finalist for the Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Award. His writing has appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Elle</em>, <em>Parade</em>, <em>Real Simple</em>, <em>Redbook</em>, and elsewhere.

Incredible as it may seem Safari Press has been able to surpass the first volume with an almost unbelievable array of new trophy rooms.</p><p>This is the second volume in what is universally hailed as the best photographic collection on the world&#39;s top hunters and their trophy rooms. See Renato Luca&#39;s incredible castle in northern Italy with most of the game animals of the world life-size, as well as thousands of mounted birds; see the famous Kenneth Whitehead deer museum that is the only place in the world housing every single deer species under one roof, including a whole skeleton of a giant elk with antlers having an eleven-foot spread! Also included are photos of life-size argali sheep, the world-famous red stag collection of Hugo Vitullo, Bruno Scherrer&#39;s life-size giraffe, and half-a-dozen trophy rooms from the palaces of India&#39;s most famous hunting maharajas. Some of the most exquisitely detailed and designed rooms have been photographed, as well as many interesting artifacts that rival some trophy collections! Informative text on the owners of these rooms (O&#39;Connor, Klein, Pocius, Thummler, Gates, and Yuren to name a few) written by the hunters themselves has been combined with these amazing photos to make this an outstanding photographic essay on the world&#39;s top hunters.

And, for the moment, it&#x2019;s also a port in the storm for Odd Thomas and his traveling companion, the inscrutably charming Annamaria. In the wake of Odd&#x2019;s most recent clash with lethal adversaries, the opulent manor&#x2019;s comforts should be welcome. But there&#x2019;s far more to Roseland than meets even the extraordinary eye of Odd, who soon suspects it may be more hell than haven.</p><p></p><p>A harrowing taste of Roseland&#x2019;s terrors convinces Odd that it&#x2019;s time to hit the road again. Still, the prescient Annamaria insists that they&#x2019;ve been led there for a reason. Just how deep and dreadful are the mysteries Roseland and her masters have kept for nearly a century? And what consequences await whoever is brave, or mad, enough to confront the most profound breed of evil? Odd only knows. Like his acclaimed creator, the irresistible Odd Thomas is in top-notch form&#x2014;as he takes on what may well be the most terrifying challenge yet in his curious career.</p><p></p></p><p><p><em></em><strong>An interview with Michael Koryta (<em>The Prophet</em>). </strong><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>MICHAEL: </strong>In the new novel, <em>Odd Apocalypse</em>, you write that "between birth and burial, we find ourselves in a comedy of mysteries." That statement could be a guiding light for the <em>Odd</em> series, and perhaps even your work in general of late. Was allowing the laughs to join the darkness a conscious decision?</p> <p><strong>DEAN: </strong>Humor began to enter my work as far back as <em>Watchers</em> (1987), and by <em>Lightning</em> (1988), my agent and publisher at that time became alarmed and counseled me that suspense and humor never mix. They were not able to offer a cogent explanation of why the two never mix. One of my favorite films of all time is "North by Northwest," which is tense and funny; so I just kept doing what I was doing. By the time I moved to Bantam Books with <em>Fear Nothing</em> (1998), humor became the binding glue in all of my books except for <em>The Taking</em>, <em>Velocity</em>, <em>The Husband</em>, and <em>Your Heart Belongs to Me</em>.</p> <p>Odd Thomas is speaking for me when he says, "Humanity is a parade of fools, and I'm right up front with a baton." Odd is a spiritual guy, and in my experience, genuinely spiritual people--as opposed to those for whom faith is either a crutch or a bludgeon--have a great sense of humor. They recognize that our fallen world is not just tragic but also absurd, often hilariously absurd, and that laughing at humanity's hubris and reckless transgressive behavior is a potent way to deny legitimacy to that hubris. Besides, if a character is able to make you laugh out loud, a bond is formed that ensures you will worry more for him when he finds himself in jeopardy. And I will always remember that it wasn't my looks or my sartorial splendor or macho toughness--ha!--that won Gerda; she says that she laughed so much on our first date, her stomach hurt the next day. That was better than being told, as I expected, that her stomach hurt because, after I took her home, she spent the night throwing up.</p> <p><strong>MICHAEL: </strong>A three-part short novel titled <em>Odd Interlude</em> was released in ebook-only form this summer. Tell us a little about the way this was conceived and written. Did you have that planned before the new novel or did it come to you later in Odd's journey?</p> <p><strong>DEAN: </strong>I had written a 32,000-word ebook novella, <em>The Moonlit Mind</em>, to intrigue readers about a forthcoming novel, <em>77 Shadow Street</em>. The novella sold very well and drew strong reader response. In fact, I'm pretty sure a lot of people liked <em>Moonlit</em> better than <em>77 Shadow Street</em>! So as I was finishing <em>Odd Apocalypse</em>, my publisher asked me to write a 60,000- to 70,000-word short novel in three parts to reintroduce readers to Odd. It was outside the seven-book arc of the series, and I had great fun with it. By the way, those readers who don't do ebooks tend to get exercised about a piece appearing only digitally. In order to avoid being whacked by an irate reader while waiting at the counter for my Big Mac, I am happy to tell you that <em>Odd Interlude</em> will be published in paperback within a few months.</p> <p><strong> MICHAEL: </strong>Rumor has it a movie of Odd Thomas is on the way, and that you're pleased with it, which is anything but the rule when it comes to adaptations. What can you tell us about the film version and why you are so pleased with Stephen Sommers' take?</p> <p><strong>DEAN: </strong>I have a glowing review of the film at deankoontz.com and on my official Facebook page. Anton Yelchin and Addison Timlim give wonderfully nuanced and affecting performances. Steve's sense of pace and his writing are even better than his previous best, and his scene transitions are amazing, something really new and highly effective. The picture drops much from the book, but at the same time it's absolutely true to the book, to its characters and its themes.</p> <p>Steve is also a great guy and a family man. When he'd send me long emails about progress on the picture, he'd write also about his daughters and family things. After one such email, I wrote him back to say that he was so normal, compared to most of my Hollywood experiences, that I was getting suspicious. I said I was steeling myself to wake up one morning and discover that he'd been arrested with Charlie Sheen, crossing the border from Mexico in a school bus loaded with drugs and explosives. <br></p> <p>(continued)</p> <p>&gt;Read the full interview<br>&gt;See all of Michael Koryta's books</p> <p><br></p>Dean Koontz, the author of many #1 New York Times bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Anna, and the enduring spirit of their golden, Trixie.</p><h2>Field Guide to Fantastic Creatures</h2><p>This book is a unique natural history of over 100 fantastic creatures.

Manzanar portrays one of these: the internments of Japanese-Americans during World War II. John Hersey's lengthy essay, "A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible Proportions," opens this description of the largest of the detainment camps, Manzanar. His clear and complete description of the political and historical circumstances surrounding the internments and the hysteria and prejudice that prompted them is interspersed with Adams' photographs, which provide a record of the camp that words cannot, a feeling of what life there was like that the text rarely offers. The faces of the internees make more obvious the contrast between the prejudice against the Japanese-Americans and the individual realities. The chapters by Wright and Armor offer a portrayal of the response of internees to their imprisonment. The book also addresses the aftermath of detainment: the return home to stolen possessions and lost homes; the legal battles (some still being deliberated); and the bill to pay some reparation, made law in 1988. Other accounts, notably Farewell to Manzanar (Bantam, 1974) by Jeannie Wakatsuki Houston, personalize Manzanar's history.<br><i>- Sally Bates, Houston Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Armor, Wright, and Hersey vividly describe the disgraceful relocation of Japanese Americans in World War II. Specific attention to Manzanar, the first camp, appears in the form of 100 photographs taken by Ansel Adams in 1943. The pictures hint at suffering but more clearly reveal Americans who maintained their dignity and patriotism during harsh trial. Some of the pictures (not all were available for review) appeared in Adams's Born Free and Equal (1944), now rare. Other works deal more completely with the relocation experience and camp life (e.g., Jeanne W. and James D. Houston's Farewell to Manzanar, 1973), but Manzanar would be valuable in American and Japanese studies collections that lack Born Free and Equal . Kenneth W. Berger, Duke Univ.

It was nothing less than a major political realignment, as the direction of federal policy shifted from conservative to liberal&#x2014;and liberalism itself was redefined in the process.<br><br><i>Electing FDR</i> is the first book in seventy years to examine in its entirety the 1932 presidential election that ushered in the New Deal. Award-winning historian Donald Ritchie looks at how candidates responded to the nation's economic crisis and how voters evaluated their performance. More important, he explains how the Democratic Party rebuilt itself after three successive Republican landslides: where the major shifts in party affiliation took place, what contingencies contributed to FDR's victory, and why the new coalition persisted as long as it did.<br><br>Ritchie challenges prevailing assumptions that the Depression made Roosevelt's election inevitable. He shows that FDR came close to losing the nomination to contenders who might have run to the right of Hoover, and discusses the role of newspapers and radio in presenting the candidates to voters. He also analyzes Roosevelt's campaign strategies, recounting his attempts to appeal to disaffected voters of all ideological stripes, often by altering his positions to broaden his popularity.<br><br>With the advent of the New Deal, Americans came to enjoy a wide federal safety net that provided everything from old age pensions to rural electricity-government innovations so embraced by voters that even later conservative presidents recognized their importance. Ritchie traces this legacy through the Reagan and Bush years, but he relates how FDR in 1932 was often vague about the specifics of his program and questions whether voters really knew what they were in for with the New Deal. <br><br>As pundits, politicians, and citizens eye the upcoming 2008 campaign, <i>Electing FDR</i> reminds incumbents not to take their party support for granted or to underestimate their opponents-and reminds students of history that understanding the New Deal begins with the 1932's transformative election.</p><p>"A wonderful history of that moment in November 1932 when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president and modern liberalism was born."--Gary Gerstle, coeditor of <i>The Rise and Fall of the New Deal Order</i> <p>"A lively and vivid account of a crucial election we take for granted today, though it was very much up for grabs at the time."--Allan M.

Because there is no bibliography, it is impossible to know if Collins' research included Potter's childhood journals, decoded and published in 1966. However, such details as the relationship that the young Potter had with the family servants and what she ate for her meals are certainly the stuff of such journals. The book draws a fairly clear portrait of Potter's stuffy Victorian family, but in its brevity and easy-to-read format, Potter's timid, dutiful personality emerges only slightly. Patricia Frevert's Beatrix Potter: Children's Storyteller (Creative Ed., 1981) is aimed at older readers.

Over the course of a weekend, the men reveal their secret hopes, fears, and passions as they choose roles, spend a long night of the soul preparing for the play, and finally enact their bizarre ritual for what may be the last time.

He is the author of <i>Physician: The Life of Paul Beeson.</i>Adult/High School&#x2013;This is a fascinating account of how two isolated and unknown individuals overcame significant obstacles and revolutionized the study of the nervous system more than 100 years ago. Work by Santiago Ram�n y Cajal, a Spaniard, and Camillo Golgi, an Italian, led to the identification by Cajal of entities now called synapses that permit communication between nerve cells. Golgi invented a staining procedure, refined by Cajal, that unlocked many secrets of the nervous system. Golgi believed in a reticular structure in which all nerve cells were connected to each other; Cajal demonstrated that this was not correct and established the neuronal theory, the foundation of the current understanding of nervous-system function. The book includes illustrations of nerve-cell structures produced by Cajal and is an excellent introduction to how neural science advanced at the end of the 19th century. Personal considerations and conflict, national and international prejudice, and cultural differences are set against the evolving geopolitical background as Europe slipped toward the First World War. Cajal, Golgi, and others used primitive light microscopes. The volume describes how the earlier work is being continued with such modern techniques as electron microscopy and how current research is examining the role of synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Students of the history of science and cultural change should find <i>Nerve Endings</i> interesting and informative. Teens studying biology and medicine will find that the book provides an accessible introduction to understanding the structure and function of the nervous system.<i>&#x2013;Ted Woodcock, George Mason University, Arlington, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After a cursory description of the development of the instrument itself, she discusses early cellists in chapters arranged according to country. Outstanding cellists of more recent years are discussed at greater length, with the longest passages given to a few of the best known, including Casals, Piatigorsky, Rostropovich and du Pre.

It traces the emergence of art history as a discipline, the establishment of norms of scholarly inquiry, and the involvement of art historians in wider debates about the cultural and political identity of the monarchy. </p><p>The so-called Vienna School plays the central role in the study, but Rampley also examines the formation of art history elsewhere in Austria-Hungary. Located in the Habsburg imperial capital, Vienna art historians frequently became entangled in debates that were of importance to art historians elsewhere in the Empire, and Rampley pays particular attention to these areas of overlapping interest. He also analyzes the methodological innovations for which the Vienna School was well known. Rampley focuses most fully, however, on the larger political and ideological context of the practice of art history&#x2014;particularly the way in which art-historical debates served as proxies for wider arguments over the political, social, and cultural life of the Habsburg Empire. </p></p><p><p>Matthew Rampley is Chair of Art History at the University of Birmingham.</p>&#x201c;This is the most commendable art-historical text to come my way in a long time, a major intellectual achievement on all fronts. Very much to his credit, Rampley writes in gracefully lucid language, something that cannot be said about many scholars attracted to this material.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Michael Yonan, <i>Austrian History Yearbook</i><br><br>&#x201c;Matthew Rampley&#x2019;s recent study <i>The Vienna School of Art History: Empire and the Politics of Scholarship, 1847&#x2013;1918</i> presents an interesting corrective to simplistic definitions of &#x2018;German art history,&#x2019; for it investigates the effects of a multilingual discipline upon institutional discourses. His arguments move the methodological problems analysed in Frank and Adler&#x2019;s collection right into the heart of European politics by offering a thorough and sustained interrogation not of the methods per se, but of the relationship between the idea of scientific method and liberalism.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Francesco Ventrella, <i>Art History</i><br><br>&#x201c;The first quality one might expect in yet another book on [this] subject would be a fair and consistent referencing of . . . secondary literature. With <i>The Vienna School of Art History: Empire and the Politics of Scholarship, 1847&#x2013;1918</i>, Matthew Rampley fulfills this expectation meticulously; indeed the latter quality pervades the work as a whole, deftly managing a large body of information and complex thought within what is not an overly long book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Stefan Muthesius, <i>CAA.Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;Matthew Rampley&#x2019;s status as one of the foremost scholars of the historiography of art is on full display in this meticulously researched and detailed account of the rise of the first Vienna School of art history. . . . Rampley&#x2019;s book is a necessary corrective and addition to the existing scholarship on the Vienna School.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Max Koss, <i>CritCom: A Forum for Research and Commentary on Europe</i><br><br>&#x201c;Most art historians know a little about the Vienna School of art history, and many of them have read a couple of essays from that formative period, especially those by Riegl or Dvo&#x159;�k. Yet none, I wager, has ever attempted to envision an entire social and intellectual biography of this complicated and contradictory culture that spawned the serious beginnings of the history of art. A learned historiographer to the core, Matthew Rampley has accomplished just that feat. Packed with erudition (not to mention endnotes!), this hefty text (in more ways than one) serves to provide telling episodes from early German-speaking art history across the imperial Habsburg map.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Michael Ann Holly, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute<br><br>&#x201c;Matthew Rampley&#x2019;s lucid book is the first truly synthetic study of the first Vienna School of art history, one that does a magnificent job of placing the school in the context of the cultural politics of the late Habsburg Empire. Drawing on a wealth of sources in many of the Empire&#x2019;s languages, Rampley shows how the school&#x2019;s most famous members&#x2014;Alois Riegl, Max Dvo&#x159;�k, Josef Strzygowski&#x2014;fit into a much richer and wider set of debates about modern art, monument conservation, the West&#x2019;s relationship to the Orient, the meaning of the Baroque, and the relationship between German-speaking Austria and &#x2018;the rest.&#x2019; Especially original and important is Rampley&#x2019;s focus on art-historical controversies on the Empire&#x2019;s peripheries. This is a crucial book, not only for scholars interested in the historiography of art history, but also for specialists in Habsburg cultural history.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Suzanne Marchand, Louisiana State University<br><br>&#x201c;The Institute of Art History at the University of Vienna was, up until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a state apparatus affiliated in purpose to the Institute of History and the Imperial Royal Central Commission for the Research and Preservation of Architectural Monuments. In this important study of the practices of the art historians from the dual monarchy&#x2019;s various regions, Matthew Rampley focuses on the ideological tensions generated by their work. Imperial demands for unity conflicted with nationalistic demands for independence. Furthermore, Vienna itself was the site of competing interests and demands epitomized in the existence of two art-historical institutes, led by Max Dvo&#x159;�k and Josef Strzygowski. Rampley&#x2019;s book is essential reading for the study of the politics of art-historical debate, displaying both its complexity and its internal contradictions. Its particular strength is its wide-ranging coverage of original source materials drawing attention to the work of hitherto marginalized art historians, both in Vienna and across the empire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Richard Woodfield, editor, <i>Journal of Art Historiography</i><br><br>&#x201c;The ideas and writings of the early members of the Vienna School laid the foundations for modern art history.

And when someone very dear to him is kidnapped, Hayden may sacrifice everything in a reckless pursuit to save her. . . .</p><p><b>S. Thomas Russell</b> is a lifelong sailor whose passion for the sea&#x2014;and love of nautical history&#x2014;inspired the adventures of Charles Hayden. He lives on Vancouver Island in Canada.<p></p><p>One</p><p>Lady Hattingale, accompanied by the physician, descended the great stair a few steps at a time, paused, her head inclined and nodding at the doctor&#x2019;s words, and then undertook the next three steps. The butler awaited them at the bottom, a near-statue of discretion and deferment. When the physician and the noblewoman came near he whispered a few words and both physician and lady turned their attention to Charles Hayden, who waited ten paces distant.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Hayden,&#x201d; she said, crossing towards him.</p><p>Hayden made a leg. &#x201c;Lady Hattingale.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dr Goodwin, our physician.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have come to enquire of Lord Arthur,&#x201d; she said&#x2014;it was not a question.</p><p>&#x201c;And to speak with him if it is possible.&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Hattingale glanced at the physician, who seemed to consider this request most seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;I do not think it would do any great harm,&#x201d; the doctor decreed. &#x201c;Ten minutes, though, no more. Do not speak on any subject that might cause him distress.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is he yet so fragile?&#x201d; Hayden asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He lost a great deal of blood. I am still somewhat surprised that he survived. But the young are full of surprises.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And his arm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will see. I think he will keep it, but he may never have full use of it again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Dr Goodwin,&#x201d; Hayden said, &#x201c;for all you have done.&#x201d;</p><p>The man made a modest nod. &#x201c;Who is your surgeon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Obadiah Griffiths.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carry him my compliments. I do not think Lord Arthur would have survived without his timely ministrations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will very gladly do so,&#x201d; Hayden replied.</p><p>Lady Hattingale saw the doctor to the door and the butler took Hayden up to Lord Arthur. He was let into a large, sun-flooded room, where he found Wickham buried under a sea of white coverlets. The midshipman&#x2019;s face beamed like a lighthouse upon seeing his shipmate.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Hayden, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a cosy little cabin they have given you, Wickham. You must be an admiral now to have such a cot.&#x201d; Hayden sat down upon a bedside chair. &#x201c;You are pale as a cloud. I have seen fish bellies not half so white as you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am told I left half my allotment of blood upon the deck of our ship, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone is always cleaning up after you reefers.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you speak to Dr Goodwin, sir? Did he say when I might be allowed on my feet again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He did not. All he said was that you are recovering apace and that you should be playing the fiddle again in a fortnight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother will be most happy to hear it. I was a terrible disappointment as a musical prodigy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, there, you see, one advantage already&#x2014;a happy mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Both fell silent a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Did we lose many men, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We took losses, yes. But all our <i>Themis</i>es came through unharmed, you excepted. Did I never tell you not to stand in the way of a musket ball?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did, sir, but I forgot myself in all the excitement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is why you should listen to your elders, for I am four and twenty and you are but six and ten.&#x201d;</p><p>Again a silence settled around them.</p><p>&#x201c;I am told there is to be a medal, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is the rumour. All the captains Lord Howe saw fit to mention in his missives to the Admiralty are to receive a medal for their part in the battle on June first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must have been mentioned, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By some miracle, I was. I did not think the admiral knew my name. He did not, however, mention a number of captains who I am certain shall feel they have been slighted. I expect there will be a great deal of resultant ill will.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham nodded, as there was nothing new in this; admirals always had their favourites. &#x201c;Have you any news, sir? Are we given orders?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I</i> have been given orders. Y<i>ou</i> are to rest and recover.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham nodded and glanced away, blinking.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is <i>Raisonnable</i> bound, if a mere landsman may ask?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are no landsman, Wickham, but only temporarily aground. The spring tide will float you off. I am the captain of <i>Raisonnable</i> no more, but have been given a new ship. One you are more than a little familiar with. <i>Themis</i> is her name&#x2014;a fine frigate with a black character.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Themis</i>, sir!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed, and we are sent on convoy duty into the Baltic, with most of your old shipmates aboard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, sir, whenaway? Mayhap I will be recovered enough to take ship with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We sail within the week, but I expect you to buckle down and recover so you will be ship shape when we return. Mr Stephens has informed me that it is likely we will be sent to the West Indies after the hurricane season has passed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;November, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not before December, I should think. That gives you some goodly amount of time to complete your refit and resume your station aboard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shall set the dockyard hands to work on my ailing limb immediately, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am happy to hear it. The midshipmen&#x2019;s berth has become a nursery, full of children who do not know which end is which&#x2014;and I am talking about their person, not the ship. I need you back to instruct these boys in the finer points of being an officer in His Majesty&#x2019;s Navy.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham grinned. &#x201c;I remember, sir, when I first set foot aboard in my new rig with gleaming buttons and snow-white breeches.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I remember my first days as well. I could hardly comprehend a thing that went on around me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was the same, sir. And then a new, young lieutenant came aboard and taught us all what service meant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know those new lieutenants, all brash and thinking they know all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope to be one myself, some day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were an excellent acting lieutenant, Wickham, and not in the least brash or all-knowing. Why, I should recommend you to any theatre company, you were so convincing.&#x201d;</p><p>This almost put a hint of colour into the midshipman&#x2019;s face, and he appeared to search for something to say.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been reading the papers,&#x201d; Wickham offered, &#x201c;one-handed.&#x201d; He tried to smile. &#x201c;Do you think that Robespierre can survive the summer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not know,&#x201d; Hayden said, feeling his spirits sink. He had had no news of his family in France for many months. &#x201c;The Committee is sending anyone to the guillotine, almost without trial&#x2014;a mere accusation is enough to take a man&#x2019;s head. It is a frightening time to be French. There must be a backlash against this&#x2014;there must be a return to reason.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened then and Lady Hattingale entered. Immediately, Hayden rose to his feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Please sit, Captain Hayden,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I am but a nursing sister here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your ministrations have worked a small miracle,&#x201d; Hayden observed. &#x201c;This midshipman appears well on his way to a full recovery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He is doing splendidly, but forcing him to rest is my greatest contribution&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which he resists at all times. Perhaps, Captain, you might order him to stay abed until the doctor allows him to quit it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr Wickham, I hereby order you to rest until this good nurse and the physician allow you to rise. In fact, you are to follow their instructions in every detail. Do you comprehend what I am saying?&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham nodded submissively. &#x201c;Aye, sir. I shall do all within my power to be a better invalid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it is not in my nature.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Hayden responded, &#x201c;it is not, but you will be back aboard ship the sooner for a little patience, I am certain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it three o&#x2019;clock already?&#x201d; Lady Hattingale enquired as the mantel clock chimed. &#x201c;You see, Lord Arthur, how quickly time speeds? You shall be on your feet in no time at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden took the hint and rose.</p><p>&#x201c;I must bid you adieu, Lady Hattingale, and thank you again for all you have done for Lord Arthur. We all believe he will be an admiral one day, if he does not want to be Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He will make a better admiral, I think,&#x201d; she answered, and rose as well. &#x201c;Let me walk you out, Captain.&#x201d; Then, to Wickham: &#x201c;You have your orders, Lord Arthur. Rest. I shall find you another book to read.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden gave a nod to Wickham, who touched an invisible hat with his good hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for coming, sir. Remember me to the others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not think they have forgotten; they ask about you hourly. We will be back from our convoy in a few weeks and I will look in on you at that time. Be well.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham gave a nod, appearing suddenly unable to speak.</p><p>Hayden and Lady Hattingale went into the hallway beyond, and towards the stair. She was a very tall woman of perhaps fifty years, though she carried these lightly. She was elegantly but simply dressed and wore no jewellery&#x2014;not even a ring. To Hayden she seemed a practical and steady woman&#x2014;just the sort he would choose to nurse his unlucky midshipman.</p><p>&#x201c;He appears thin as a whip,&#x201d; Hayden observed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he very nearly did not survive,&#x201d; Lady Hattingale replied, shaking her head but a little. &#x201c;I thank God that he is on the mend and hope he does not take a sudden turn. Lord and Lady Sanstable will arrive presently.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I expected them here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were visiting in the north but I am certain set out the very instant they had word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry not to have met them. Lord Sanstable has been a good friend to both me and my ship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And well he should be,&#x201d; she said, and smiled. &#x201c;Lord Arthur worships the ground you walk upon&#x2014;or perhaps I should say &#x2018;deck.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I cannot imagine that is true.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lord Sanstable is convinced you have been a great and good influence upon his son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder if His Lordship will feel the same after he has seen his son so gravely hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could protect him only at the cost of his honour,&#x201d; Lady Hattingale very wisely observed. &#x201c;Lord Sanstable comprehends this.&#x201d;</p><p>The final stair was reached and in a moment they arrived at the great entrance.</p><p>Hayden paused. &#x201c;Thank you again, Lady Hattingale, for all you have done for Lord Arthur.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have known him since the day his mother brought him into this world, Captain Hayden. I could not have done less and wish I might do more.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden was out the door, where a groom stood waiting with his hired horse. Portsmouth was but a short ride, and all the way there Hayden found himself overcome with the most morbid feelings and such tides of emotion that he could hardly keep his saddle. All of the midshipmen were his charges, given into his safekeeping by apprehensive parents. But the truth was he could not keep them safe. He could try to make them good sea officers, but they would ever face mortal danger. Wickham, he realised, had become something of a prot�g�&#x2014;more like a nephew than a young gentleman. Of course, it flattered Hayden to think of himself somehow part of such a distinguished family&#x2014;for he was of more modest stock. But musket balls did not care what colour blood they spilled&#x2014;blue or red, it was all the same to them. That was the harsh truth of the sea officer&#x2019;s life. Anyone who stood upon a quarterdeck was a target for enemy fire. Hayden, Archer, Wickham&#x2014;they could all easily end their lives sewn up in a hammock, slipped over the side into a dark, watery grave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there to wait until the sea shall give up her dead.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>It began as an uneventful crossing&#x2014;if crossing a vast and volatile ocean in the dead of winter could ever be construed as uneventful. A three-day gale in mid-December, however, changed all that and set in chain a series of &#x201c;events&#x201d; unlike any Hayden had ever known or even imagined.</p><p>To begin, three men were thrown down from aloft; two broke on the deck and departed this life upon that instant, but the third, beyond all odds, landed upon one of his fellows, who had not heard the cries, and now it appeared to be a question of which would live, for both lay in the sick-berth sorely hurt.</p><p>The next event was less dramatic but infinitely more sensitive. Hayden had been prevailed upon by Admiral Caldwell, the commander-in-chief of the Barbados station, to carry the admiral&#x2019;s secretary out with him. The man, who was also a cousin to the admiral&#x2019;s wife, was presently installed in a cabin in the <i>Themis</i>&#x2019; gunroom. And it was in regard to this particular gentleman that Lieutenant Benjamin Archer had approached his captain.</p><p>Beyond the gallery windows, night&#x2019;s sullen tide gathered on the eastern horizon. Across the sky, however, quickly fading shades of pale purple, rose, and gold appeared to have been pastelled upon the clouds. Shortly, a servant would slip in to light the lamps. The frigate&#x2019;s cabin, which had once seemed as grand as a ballroom to Hayden, now appeared cramped and dreary compared to the great cabin he had so recently vacated upon the sixty-four-gun ship <i>Raisonnable</i>. He had been too junior a captain to retain such a command and now he was back on the ship no other officer wanted, his rise and fall so rapid he had barely a moment to register either. At least, he reminded himself, he had retained his post. <i>And</i> he was not headed north into the Baltic on convoy duty, where he had so recently spent several cold, wet months, often fog bound and land-blind. Instead, he shaped his ship&#x2019;s course towards the West Indies, and the warmth of those verdant islands had reached out to the crew of the <i>Themis</i> the previous week.</p><p>Archer stood in his usual post-somnolent state, uniform not quite dishevelled enough to provoke comment. In his hand he held a small square of cream-coloured paper, neatly folded. The young lieutenant was struggling to find some way to begin and looked sheepish or, perhaps, embarrassed, Hayden could not say which.</p><p>&#x201c;And what is it, exactly, that Mr Percival has done to distress you so, Mr Archer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he has given a poem to Mr Maxwell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The cherub?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Midshipman Maxwell had been dubbed &#x201c;the cherub&#x201d; the instant he had set foot on the deck, for no one aboard had ever seen a youngster who so resembled a seraph, from his curly, yellow locks and rosy cheeks to his rather angelic smile.</p><p>&#x201c;That hardly seems a capital offence&#x2014;unless it is a particularly bad poem.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is rather good, sir, but then his claim to have written it is somewhat exaggerated, as I believe a player by the name of Shakespeare wrote a very similar poem some years past.&#x201d; He held the poem out to the somewhat mystified Hayden.</p><p>Hayden unfolded the paper, and there, in a very beautiful hand, was written:</p><p>Shall I compare thee to a summer&#x2019;s day?</p><p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate.</p><p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p><p>And summer&#x2019;s lease hath all too short a date.</p><p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</p><p>And often is his gold complexion dimmed</p><p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p><p>By chance or nature&#x2019;s changing course untrimmed;</p><p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade</p><p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#x2019;st.</p><p>Nor shall Death brag thou wander&#x2019;st in his shade</p><p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#x2019;st.</p><p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p><p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p><p>&#x201c;So Mr Percival gave this poem to Mr Maxwell, claiming it to be of his own making&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to impress our young midsh...</p></p><h2>The Manufacturing of a President</h2><p>This book covers Barack H.

Research is based on formerly classified Cia and State Department files, personal interviews, and international investigations. Obama&#39;s birth certificate has never been the issue. The real issue, which affects his eligibility to serve as President of the United States, is his past and likely current Indonesian citizenship. The reader will be taken through the labyrinth of covert Cia operations in Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions.

See what happens." So Todd Gitlin advises the young mind burning to take action to right the wrongs of the world but also looking for bearings, understanding, direction, and practical examples.In Letters to a Young Activist, Todd Gitlin looks back at his eventful life, recalling his experience as president of the formidable Students for a Democratic Society in the '60s, contemplating the spirit of activism, and arriving at some principles of action to guide the passion and energy of those wishing to do good. He considers the three complementary motives of duty, love, and adventure, and reflects on the changing nature of idealism and how righteous action requires realistic as well as idealistic thinking. And he looks forward to an uncertain future that is nevertheless full of possibility, a future where patriotism and intelligent skepticism are not mutually exclusive.Gitlin invites the young activist to enter imaginatively into some of the dilemmas, moral and practical, of being a modern citizen--the dilemmas that affect not only the problems of what to think but also the problems of what to love and how to live.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Todd Gitlin</b> is Professor of Culture, Journalism, and Sociology at New York University and University of California at Berkeley. He is the author of numerous books, including the classic <i>The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage</i>. He lives in New York City.Gitlin, a Columbia University professor of sociology and journalism, is a former president of Students for a Democratic Society, SDS, an influential radical '60s group, one of whose primary focuses was anti-Vietnam War activities. Although his stated intention is to provide a guide for future activists, Gitlin may find a more receptive audience among baby boomers who participated in the '60s antiwar protests and have struggled to extract meaning from their own history. While Gitlin tries hard to convince his target audience that he understands them and once felt as they now feel-angry, impatient, outraged and above all convinced of his own rightness-it is unclear whether they would embrace his conclusions any more than Gitlin's generation embraced the suggestions of the Old Left. Such a response might be unfortunate, as Gitlin, who writes earnestly and has a knack for aphoristic observations, has some unusual points. For example, he derides Ralph Nader's third-party run for president as "narcissism wearing a cloak of ideals." He also offers insightful observations on the need for both outsider activists and sympathetic insiders to make meaningful changes in public policy, the dangers of identity politics and the requirement that activists willingly seek and accept institutional power. He eloquently argues for the need to resist the temptation of violence. On more than one occasion, however, Gitlin's prose is abstract and convoluted, verging on the overwrought. He also sometimes loses control of his metaphors ("when guilt and rage slip their leash, they murder the future in the name of an unsalvageable past"). By and large, though, this is a generous and well-meaning book, which may interest aging activists and, perhaps, the young audience at which it is aimed. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Best of Black Mountain Quilts</h2><p>Now you can own all the most popular designs from the renowned Black Mountain Quilts company in this pattern-packed collection! <p>o Choose from 30 lap-size to twin-size quilt patterns </p><p>o Themes from roses and tulips to fruits and berries will keep you quilting year round; you'll even find an entire chapter dedicated to a Black Mountain Christmas </p><p>o Use simple piecing and fusible appliqu� to stitch up quilts quickly and easily</p></p><p>Hometown: Orange, California <p>Teri Christopherson is a popular designer who has self-published 13 books and 28 quilt patterns under her company Black Mountain Quilts, which she founded in 1993.

All three, he makes clear, have been founders of languages--Loyola, the language of divine address; Sade, the language of erotic freedom; and Fourier, the language of social perfection and happiness. Each language is an all-enveloping system, a "secondary language" that isolates the adherent from the conventional world. The object of this book, Barthes makes clear, is not to decipher the content of these respective works, but to consider Sade, Fourier, and Loyola as creators of text. </p><p>"Here they are all three brought together, the evil writer, the great utopian, and the Jesuit saint. There is not intentional provocation in this assembling (were there provocation, it would rather consist in treating Sade, Fourier, and Loyola as though they had not had faith: in God, the Future, Nature), no transcendence (the sadist, the contestator, and the mystic are not redeemed by sadism, revolution, religion), and, I add of these studies, although first published (in part) seperately, was from the first conceived to join the others in one book: the book of Logothetes, founders of language."--from the Preface</p></p><p><p>Barthes examines the parallel impulses of Loyola, the Jesuit saint, Sade, the renowned and sometimes pornographic libertine philosopher, and Fourier, the utopian theorist.

The premise is deceptively simple: Chris Neilson has died in a car accident, but his life-force--his spirit--is still conscious of this plane of reality. And he is still too in love with his wife, Ann, to completely let go. She in turn does not want to go on living without him, as each regards the other as their soul mate. What Chris will do to get back with Ann after she dies makes for one of the most unusual love stories ever told. Even though the story can be enjoyed as pure fantasy, what makes <i>What Dreams May Come</i> unique is how the author spent years researching the subject of life after death. (An exhaustive bibliography is included to verify this.) And while Matheson admits that the characters are of course fictional, he also states that "With few exceptions, every other detail is derived exclusively from research." Whether, after reading this novel, one believes in life after death is of course a matter of opinion.

Readers who enjoyed Baker's <i>The Frog Princess</i> and <i>Dragon's Breath</i> are the likeliest audience for this addition to the series as it seems to exist primarily to tie up loose ends. Even in this regard, though, it is disappointing. So much of the text is devoted to recapping the plots of the first two titles that there is not much room for a new story and the pace of this book is slowed considerably: " 'I'll put the spell in a ball like the ones we used when we fought King Beltran and turned his soldiers into frogs and mice,'" Emma calls to Eadric in the thick of battle. With such roundabout descriptions of the action, it's difficult to keep one's attention focused on the confrontation at hand.

With advancements in telecommunications, a new type of wire - multi-colored plastic-coated copper wire, often referred to as telephone wire - came into being. Beginning in the late 1960&#39;s, Zulu night watchmen started weaving scraps of this wire around their traditional sticks. This new material was also applied to making izimbenge - beer pot covers - that had been traditionally made from grass and palm. Today, there is wide variety in the creative use of this wire, and, in post-Apartheid South Africa, Zulu craft artists are imbuing old forms with the colourful contemporary material of telecommunications. The result is a vibrant, distinctive new folk form gaining international attention. This is the first and only publication to document the development of this transitional art. Including more than two-hundred examples of baskets, this book traces telephone-wire weaving from its roots to its most current forms, featuring the works of the most renowned contemporary weavers. The accompanying text - from some of the foremost experts in African art and craft - traces the history of telephone-wire weaving as well as discussing its significance to South African culture and art history. Today telephone wire baskets are at the heart of growing markets for South African products and sustainable cultural industry in Zululand.</p><p>Dallas based art collector David Arment spent many years travelling in Africa, and bought his first telephone wire basket in 1992.

In a clear, concise text, Dr. Bassano explains how musical tones and color rays can be used for physical, emotional, and mental healing. Though practical, with easy-to-follow instructions, Bassano&#39;s methods are based on spiritual precepts. The concept is simple: we are all spiritual beings who are highly susceptible to both positive and negative energies. These energies can cause imbalances that make us depressed, physically ill, or spiritually vacant. They can also uplift us, make us well, and keep our lives in emotional and mental balance. You can easily learn which colors to wear in order to change your life, which musical tones will bring you peace, and how the body&#39;s chakras--the seven healing centers--are tuned into both music and color.

Just take the old volume, pull out or color photocopy the pages, cut them up, and then arrange the pieces in a fresh new design. That's an altered book collage, and it's a great way for paper crafters and scrapbookers to create a wonderfully personalized objet d'art. Get in on the fun of this super-popular craft with this guide to putting together that very first altered book, and beyond. The entire enjoyable process receives detailed attention. Find out how to choose a theme, the mechanics involved, and a variety of crafting techniques to use, from painting to stitching, from beading to stenciling. Hundreds of sample pages will inspire you to start designing immediately.<br></p><p>Matthiessen&#x2014;a crafter, designer and author&#x2014;isn't suggesting anything untoward when she speaks of altering books. Rather, she advocates recycling and reusing old books (and the elements crafters can use to decorate them) in the pursuit of creativity, self-expression and enjoyment. Wannabe artists uncertain of their qualifications can relax: "You do not need to be able to draw, paint, or even cut a straight line to alter a book." The art form, also known as "palimpsest," dates back to the 11th century and draws largely on traditional collage techniques. The book offers plenty of large, colorful photos that take readers step-by-step through priming and sealing a page, or perhaps embellishing a domino or glass microscope slide; lists of recommended supplies and tools aid in preparation. A gallery of creations comprises the second half of the book, and a chapter entitled "101 Ways to Alter a Book" provides further inspiration. Avid scrapbookers should have a smooth transition to this crafting arena, as will those who already have a collection of found objects and curios at the ready. Generally speaking, the artwork in the book has a shabby chic sensibility, though punk crafters could easily substitute tiny skull-and-crossbones for butterflies and fishnet for lace. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Frankl was lauded as one of the most influential thinkers of our time. <i>The Unheard Cry for Meaning</i> marked his return to the humanism that made <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> a bestseller around the world. In these selected essays, written between 1947 and 1977, Dr. Frankl illustrates the vital importance of the human dimension in psychotherapy. Using a wide range of subjects--including sex, morality, modern literature, competitive athletics, and philosophy--he raises a lone voice against the pseudo-humanism that has invaded popular psychology and psychoanalysis. By exploring mankind's remarkable qualities, he brilliantly celebrates each individual's unique potential, while preserving the invaluable traditions of both Freudian analysis and behaviorism.</p><p>VIKTOR E. FRANKL (1905-1997) was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist as well as a Holocaust survivor. He founded logotherapy and existential analysis, published more than thirty-two books, lectured and taught seminars all over the world, and received twenty-nine honorary doctorate degrees.''Emphasizes the importance of helping people to find meaning in their lives and thus to live at their fullest potential. And--needless to say--those who live fully have neither fear of life nor fear of death.'' --Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, MD<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Man's Search for Meaning:</i></b><br> ''If you read but one book this year, Dr. Frankl's book should be that one.'' --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Rosemary Remembered (China Bayles Mysteries)</h2><p>One in a popular series of mystery novels featuring herb shop owner China Bayles finds Bayles consulting a psychic for answers when she discovers a murdered woman in a pick-up truck who bears a disturbing resemblance to herself.

So learns China Bayles in her fourth novel (following Hangman's Root). The Pecan Springs, Tex., herb store owner (and former attorney) goes to retrieve lover Mike McQuaid's truck from CPA Rosemary Robbins, who has borrowed it, only to find, first, that Rosemary looks a lot like her, and, two, that Rosemary won't be filling out any more 1040s. Discussing the murder with various denizens of the small town, she learns that Rosemary was about to divorce her abusive husband and was forming a relationship with hotel co-owner Jeff Clark. Ex-cop McQuaid, meanwhile, is convinced the killer is a paroled convict who, having vowed revenge on McQuaid, mistakenly whacked Rosemary, thinking she was China. But when Jeff, who is off on a fishing vacation, becomes the local police's prime suspect, McQuaid goes to the coast to find him. Dodging threats from the ex-con and relying on the help of her friends, China solves Rosemary's murder and, in the process, forges a connection with McQuaid's Star Trek-enthralled 11-year-old son. Herb lore and China's game approach to everyday problems, as well as extraordinary ones, make this Rosemary memorable, indeed. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Introduction to Solid State Physics</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>Strange Brother (Gay Modern Classics)</h2><p>OUR COPY HAS A DIFFERENT COVER THAN STOCK PHOTO SHOWN.

It was her hope, as she said, not only to teach us this beautiful language but to be able to bring to life for us the people who formed the vibrant culture that was Rome's. I heard an echo of her words many years later when I read THE FAR ARENA, in which the protagonist wished earnestly to be able to turn a doorknob in time and find the Roman behind the door.<br><br>With Steven Saylor's mysteries, we have that Roman behind the door. Set in ancient Rome before the rise of Julius Caesar, these are not your usual cozy reads. His detective, Gordianus the Finder, seems a scruffy sort, not a noble Roman from the history books by any means, and his Rome is a rough-and-tumble place full of noisy street vendors and con artists as well as more well-to-do, upstanding citizens, a city full of gossip and intrigue and nasty politics as vicious as anything we see today. The noble Romans do appear in his books, of course, but they're a far cry from the bloodless statues who watch serenely from the covers of Latin books as students painstakingly translate their dry speeches. Marcus Tullius Cicero, for one, appears in CATILINA'S RIDDLE not as a statesman but as an underhanded schemer obsessed with destroying Lucius Sergius Catilina, who has gone down in history, rightly or wrongly, as a man who attempted to bring down the Roman Republic.

When the estate overseer is murdered, Crassus concludes that the deed was done by two missing slaves, who have probably run off to join the Spartacan Slave Revolt. Unless they are found within five days, Crassus vows to massacre his remaining ninety-nine slaves.<br>To Gordianus the Finder falls the fateful task of resolving this riddle from Hades. In a house filled with secrets, the truth is slow to emerge. And as the hour of the massacre approaches, Gordianus realizes that the labyrinthine path he has chosen just may lead to his own destruction...<br>AN ALTERNATE SELECTION OF THE BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB</p><h2>The Wheel of Things: A Biography of Lucy Maud Montgomery (Goodread Biographies)</h2><p>Lucy Maud Montgomery is Canada's best-known writer of children's fiction. <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>-- in print, film, television, on stage--captures people's imaginations as easily now as it did when it burst upon the world in 1908.<br><br>Lucy Maud Montgomery grew up in Prince Edward Island and she set her best-loved stories there.

Spread over 325 acres were 29 earthen mounds arranged around a great plaza, a mile-long stockade, and dozens of dwellings for thousands of people. Moundville, in size and complexity second only to the Cahokia site in Illinois, was a heavily populated town, as well as a political and religious center. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Moundville was sustained by tribute of food and labor provided by the people who lived in the nearby floodplain as well as other smaller mound centers. The immediate area appears to have been thickly populated, but by about A.D. 1350, Moundville retained only ceremonial and political functions. A decline ensued, and by the 1500s the area was abandoned. By the time the first Europeans reached the Southeast in the 1540s, the precise links between Moundville's inhabitants and what became the historic Native American tribes had become a mystery. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Illustrated with 50 color photos, maps, and figures, <i>Moundville</i> tells the story of the ancient people who lived there, the modern struggle to save the site from destruction, and the scientific saga of the archaeologists who brought the story to life. <i>Moundville</i> is the book to read before, during, or after a visit to Alabama&#x2019;s prehistoric metropolis.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>John H.

This volume presents the work in a new translation by Josefine Nauckhoff, with an introduction by Bernard Williams that elucidates the work&#39;s main themes and discusses their continuing importance.Nietzsche called The Gay Science "the most personal of all my books." It was here that he first proclaimed the death of God -- to which a large part of the book is devoted -- and his doctrine of the eternal recurrence. <br>Walter Kaufmann's commentary, with its many quotations from previously untranslated letters, brings to life Nietzsche as a human being and illuminates his philosophy. The book contains some of Nietzsche's most sustained discussions of art and morality, knowledge and truth, the intellectual conscience and the origin of logic. <br>Most of the book was written just before Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the last part five years later, after Beyond Good and Evil. We encounter Zarathustra in these pages as well as many of Nietzsche's most interesting philosophical ideas and the largest collection of his own poetry that he himself ever published. <br>Walter Kaufmann's English versions of Nietzsche represent one of the major translation enterprises of our time.

Salom� gives an intimate account of Rilke&#x2019;s poetic development from the early romantic poems to the sculpted new poems and the final breakthrough of the Elegies. From their romantic beginnings to the later twists and turns of their separate lives, Rilke appealed to Salom� during times of crisis in his writing as well as in the intimate matters of his life. Salom� captures both the summit and the abyss of Rilke&#x2019;s creative struggle. The memoir offers a stunning portrait of Rilke, as we in the English-speaking world have never really seen him. Richly illustrated with photos, this book is an indispensable work on the author of <i>The Duino Elegies</i>, as well as a rich resource for the growing interest in Salom�.</i></p><p><i><b>Lou Andreas-Salom� </b>was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, but lived most of her life in Germany as a famous novelist, memoirist (of Rilke, Nietzsche, and Ibsen), friend to Freud and critic. She was praised by Freud as the smartest woman he had ever met, and prized by Rilke as "one of the most wonderful people who have come my way . . . without the influence of this extraordinary woman my whole development would not have been able to take the paths that have led to many things." Salom� wrote his memoir in 1927, a year after Rilke&#x2019;s death.</i></p><p><i><b>Angela von der Lippe</b> is a senior editor at W.W. Norton. She holds a doctorate in German Literature and Language from Brown University. In her free time, she pursues a personal passion for translation and poetry. She divides her time between New York City, Baltimore and the Adirondacks.</i></p></p><p>A year after Rilke's death in 1926, Salom&#x201a;-his former lover, novelist, memoirist and muse extraordinaire-wrote this memoir of sorts documenting the poet's rich inner life. Salom&#x201a; served not only as Rilke's primary muse, but also as his lifelong correspondent and his most trusted literary confidante. Her memoir, now translated into English for the first time, bears witness to Rilke's self-doubts and insecurities as well as his greatest triumphs, culminating in the composition of his famous Duino Elegies. Although Salom&#x201a; has the potential to offer an unusually personal perspective on her one-time lover, she maintains a cool distance from him at all times. Her interest lies strictly with the development of Rilke as an artist, which makes this book a good resource for literary scholars but of little interest to the casual reader. Salom&#x201a; pays little attention to Rilke's famous friends and his family life; indeed, she makes no mention of their own three-year love affair. Instead, the memoir follows a stream-of-consciousness style, filled with excerpts from Rilke's notebooks and letters, delicately mapping out the maturation of his poetry over the course of several decades. Salom&#x201a; does not place Rilke's art within the context of his life; on the contrary, she selects tiny fragments from the poet's life and uses them only as a backdrop for discussions of his art. The memoir, and the introduction by Norton senior editor von der Lippe, takes for granted an extensive knowledge of the poet's life and his art; this volume will be of interest primarily to those who study Rilke.

Erin Merritt looked over her shoulder at her reflection in the full-length mirror hanging on her bedroom door and sighed. A good two inches of skin peeked out between the zipper teeth, taunting, Neener, neener, neener. How had this happened in just a few weeks?<br>Don&#x2019;t play dumb, scolded her inner mother. You know how this happened. And then her inner mother gave her a little pat on the shoulder. But it&#x2019;s understandable. You&#x2019;ve been under a lot of stress.<br>She had. Her job as an event planner was stressful enough. But in addition to being responsible for making all those fund-raisers and community festivals in nearby Seattle smashing successes, she&#x2019;d been working on a shoestring for the most important event of her life, her wedding.<br>If Mom were still alive it wouldn&#x2019;t have been a shoestring. Mom always said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s money when you&#x2019;re making memories? Memories are priceless.&#x201d; Especially wedding memories, and that was why Erin wanted a storybook wedding.<br>But Adam Hawthorne, her Prince Charming, kept trying to mess up the story at every turn. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to have some tight years at first. I don&#x2019;t want to rack up any more debt than we have to,&#x201d; he was always saying.<br>If she followed all Adam&#x2019;s cheapo suggestions they sure wouldn&#x2019;t have any debt. They wouldn&#x2019;t have any wedding, either. His mom had offered to spring for the cake, so there had been no need to argue over that. But they&#x2019;d argued about everything else, from the flowers (&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to budget so much for flowers, babe. My cousin could do them for us&#x2014;she&#x2019;s big into gardening.&#x201d;) to the location (&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get married in your aunt&#x2019;s backyard.&#x201d;). Nice of him to volunteer her aunt, who had already done so much for her. Adam had no problem with volunteering people to do things for them to save them money. Erin, on the other hand, was reluctant to draft free labor. It was both tacky and dangerous. Just because someone liked to arrange flowers or take pictures, that didn&#x2019;t mean the person was any good at it.<br>Okay, she got that he didn&#x2019;t want her to spend fifty thousand dollars on a wedding, but he was carrying this broke med-school-student thing way too far, especially since he wasn&#x2019;t broke and his grandfather was taking care of his medical school bills. (It paid to be an only child with generous grandparents.) Anyway, it was their wedding, for crying out loud, and she was footing the bill for most of it.<br>Adam&#x2019;s argument to that was that he was going to get her maxed-out credit card bills right along with her. So what? She&#x2019;d be the one paying them off. Anyway, how many times did a girl get married?<br>Only once, Mom used to say, and then a woman got smart. But Erin didn&#x2019;t want to get smart. She wanted to marry Adam. Wait a minute. That hadn&#x2019;t quite sounded right.<br>&#x201c;We can put the money we save toward a down payment on a house,&#x201d; Adam kept saying. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a big party. Let&#x2019;s be smart about this.&#x201d;<br>Depressed, she slipped out of the gown, returned it to its garment bag, and hung it back in her closet. She could just imagine what Adam would say if he found out she&#x2019;d outgrown the wedding gown he thought she&#x2019;d spent way too much on.<br>Why had she been so dumb as to come home from work and try the thing on anyway? Oh, yeah, to cheer herself up after her crappy day. Well, cheers.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to quit stressing,&#x201d; Adam was always saying. Funny, considering he was one of her biggest stressors.<br>Erin sighed. Okay, everyone had their faults, and Adam&#x2019;s cheapness wasn&#x2019;t really a fault. He just didn&#x2019;t get how this all worked. Weddings cost money. And you had to plan ahead, far ahead. The Heart Lake Lodge was booked a year in advance, sometimes two. And she much preferred to use that idyllic location rather than make her aunt go crazy trying to get her house ready for a wedding. She could afford to pay her way. She didn&#x2019;t have to use people.<br>Adam didn&#x2019;t know it yet, but Erin had already reserved the lodge. Her friend Bev, who worked there, had told her there&#x2019;d been a cancellation. Thank God for connections. Bev had ignored the waiting list and put their name on the event calendar. And when the time was right, Erin would tell him all about it and explain how lucky they were, and then he&#x2019;d be as excited about it as she was.<br>It was mid-January now. The wedding was in June. Hopefully, the time for telling Adam would be right soon.<br>Erin suddenly felt a need for... something. She found it fifteen minutes later at the Safeway in the chips aisle. There was nothing like chips and salsa to make a girl feel better. Chips, salsa, and a margarita, she decided, and picked up some drink mix, too, to go with the half-full bottle of tequila she had stashed at the back of the cupboard.<br>Dan Rockwell was working the express checkout tonight. He smiled at her, then eyed her grocery items. &#x201c;Party, huh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; she replied. She should have picked a different register. Then she wouldn&#x2019;t have had her brother&#x2019;s old buddy assessing her food purchases.<br>&#x201c;Doctor McDoodoo must be coming over.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s McDreamy,&#x201d; she corrected him. &#x201c;Like in Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy.&#x201d; If he was going to eavesdrop on private conversations people had every time they waited in line he should at least get the information right.<br>He nodded, pretending to be impressed. &#x201c;Oh, yeah. I forgot.&#x201d;<br>Erin gave him a look that told him exactly what she thought of his faulty memory. The obnoxious crack was hardly surprising, though. Average-looking men like Dan always hated Adam Hawthorne because he was so incredibly gorgeous. With his ice-blue eyes and that square chin, those broad shoulders and perfectly sculpted abs (not to mention the rest of him), Adam could have been a movie star.<br>She supposed Dan could have been a movie star, too, a sidekick kind of movie star&#x2014;the average-looking guy with the slightly crooked nose who did dumb stuff and said funny things and was always there for the hero, but never cool enough to be the hero.<br>Dan was a dork. He&#x2019;d been a dork ever since she&#x2019;d known him. Well, okay, there was that time when she was in seventh grade and he was in ninth that she thought he was really fabulous and had dreamed about his brown eyes and cute smile. And when a bunch of them were playing spin the bottle down in the basement at one of her brother Brett&#x2019;s dumb parties and Dan kissed her, it had given her a zing from her training bra to her toes. That zing turned to tingling mortification when he made a face afterward and said, &#x201c;Yuck, I&#x2019;m a pervert. I kissed a kid.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d show him, she thought. He&#x2019;d be sorry when she was older and really, really cool.<br>Then she got to high school and became a cheerleader, a cute blond cheerleader. Really, really cool. And it was payback time, payback for the times he&#x2019;d teased her about needing to start shaving her legs, about that stubborn zit that suddenly appeared on her chin and kept appearing ever after every month like clockwork, about anything and everything that was none of his business. She got so cool she could freeze him with a look. Pretty soon his teasing became less confident and then it dried up, and when he came over to see Brett, he just mumbled, &#x201c;Hi, Erin,&#x201d; and scooted off down the hall to Brett&#x2019;s room or out to the driveway to shoot hoops.<br>He never kissed her again until another one of her brother&#x2019;s parties in the basement. Brett had managed to become halfway cool, playing on the football team, but for some unknown reason he still stayed friends with Dan. That night, after a few illegal beers, Dan got her in a lip lock. She was no longer in training bras, but she had the same reaction. Scared by her lack of taste, she&#x2019;d slapped him and informed him he was a dork (just in case he hadn&#x2019;t figured it out). And that was the last time he ever came near her. Which, perversely, pissed her off even more.<br>After high school everyone drifted apart and moved away and she only saw him when the holidays pulled them all home. And that was about as much as she cared to see of him. After all, who needed to see someone on a regular basis who had known you since you were a kid and could remind you of all the dumb things you&#x2019;d done?<br>Now Dan had wound up living back in Heart Lake this year, like her. Only she wasn&#x2019;t staying. She was only here because Aunt Mellie was letting Erin stay in her rental house for next to nothing so she could save for the wedding. Once she was married she&#x2019;d be living in Seattle.<br>Dan would be here forever, as frozen in time as the TV dinners in the freezer cases he stocked, destined to check groceries for the rest of his natural-born days.<br>She, on the other hand, planned to make a big splash in the world of event planning and own her own company ten years from now. And that was why Adam was a perfect match. He was going places, too. And really, except for his obsession over the cost of the wedding (which he was just going to have to get over), he was perfect. Women fell all over themselves to get him to talk to them, but he only had eyes (ice blue) for her. He was going to be rich and successful. They&#x2019;d live in a beautiful house, have beautiful children (when the time was right), and take romantic vacations together. Life with Adam would be successful and secure. Perfect.<br>&#x201c;You could get fat eating all those chips by yourself,&#x201d; Dan teased, giving Erin a severe yank back into the moment at hand.<br>Her eyes popped open wide. Fat? Yes, she&#x2019;d gone up two sizes in the last six months, but... oh, God. It was really showing if grocery checkers were feeling the need to ...</p></p><h2>Eve of Destruction: A Marked Novel (Marked Series, 2)</h2><p><p><b>The Marked trilogy continues in <i>Eve of Destruction</i>, a steamy urban fantasy by #1 <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Sylvia Day, writing as S.J.

Haunted by a history of addiction, a relationship with his unsteady father, and a longing to connect with his mother who committed suicide, Flynn artfully interweaves in this memoir passages from his childhood, his relationships with women, and his growing obsession&#x2015;a questioning of terror, torture, and the political crimes we can neither see nor understand in post-9/11 American life. The time bomb of the title becomes an unlikely metaphor and vehicle for exploring the fears and joys of becoming a father. Here is a memoir of profound self-discovery&#x2015;of being lost and found, of painful family memories and losses, of the need to run from love, and of the ability to embrace it again.</p><p>Advance praise for <em>The Ticking Is the Bomb</em>:<br><br> &#x201c;Reading this book is like experiencing a very skilled surgeon performing an operation on his own insecurities and newfound fragile maturity. The written operation may be painful, but watching the scars heal on the page is a true delight.&#x201d; &#x2015;John Waters<br><br> &#x201c;Another Nick Flynn book means another marvel. <em>The Ticking Is the Bomb</em> is bold and brave, and the prose will blow you away, as will his insights on love and being. Behold.&#x201d; &#x2015;Anthony Swofford, author of <em>Jarhead</em><br><br> &#x201c;One of Nick Flynn&#x2019;s valuable talents is finding words for the unsayable. In this stunning, impressionistic meditation on accountability and the dual nature of human behavior, he is especially eloquent when showing how the personal becomes political, and how the political is deeply personal.&#x201d; &#x2015;Amy Hempel, author of <em>The Dog of Marriage</em><br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;Seeing something that everyone else insists isn&#x2019;t there&#x2019; is Nick Flynn&#x2019;s gift as a writer. No one else could have reflected with such white heat, such searing intelligence, on the photos of Abu Ghraib, while following streams of thought on his own tangled family history and the coming birth of his child. Every page is eye opening, and the book is beautiful.&#x201d; &#x2015;Joan Silber, National Book Award finalist for <em>Ideas of Heaven<br></em><br> Praise for <em>Another Bullshit Night in Suck City:</em><br><br> &#x201c;Flynn&#x2019;s talents are considerable&#x2015;he has a compelling voice and a wry sense of humor, especially about himself.&#x201d; &#x2015;Vendela Vida, <em>New York Times Book Review</em><br><br> &#x201c;[A] stunningly beautiful new memoir. . . . A near-perfect work of literature.&#x201d; &#x2015;Stephen Elliott, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>Nick Flynn is the author of Another Bullshit Night in Suck City, winner of the PEN/Martha Albrand Award, The Ticking Is the Bomb, and The Reenactments.

It is a story that reveals a new model for transformational leadership-one that flies in the face of conventional wisdom, creates healthy corporate cultures, and delivers extraordinary, sustainable results. It is a story about the personal journey transformational leaders must take in order to be true to themselves-to be in touch with themselves-and to find at journey&#39;s end that it&#39;s not about them. The Imperfect Leader will resonate with leaders at all levels and in every walk of life. It guides, equips and motivates leaders, young and old, to understand the necessity for personal transformation that is required for leaders to make a difference in their organizations. George Gallup, Jr. (The Gallup Organization) said this about The Imperfect Leader: &#34;There is one true and effective model for leadership that outperforms all others-it is time-tested and historically proven to be the leadership model for transformational change. In The Imperfect Leader, Taylor offers an interesting, well written articulation of that model. It is a very practical book that should be read by any leader seriously intending to make a difference-in their organization-or in the world.&#34;</p><p>Davis Taylor leads TAI Incorporated, a consulting firm that specializes in Values-based Leadership.

The universal familiarity of such stories as &#x201c;The Ugly Duckling,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Little Mermaid&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes&#x201d; shows how successful he was. By the time he reached middle age in the 1840s, in fact, he was probably the most famous writer in Europe, on familiar terms with kings and princes and eagerly read by a huge audience.<br>Yet the image of Andersen that has come down to us&#x2014;that of the amiable, childlike storyteller&#x2014;is bitterly at odds with the reality. In this groundbreaking biography, the first serious and comprehensive study of Andersen and his work to be undertaken in English, Jackie Wullschlager brings out the true nature of his life. Born the son of a dirt-poor cobbler and an illiterate washerwoman in a provincial Danish city, he indeed fought his way to fame in spite of his circumstances. But if his rise was astonishing, it was rarely happy. Lonely, sexually confused, vain, anxious and hypochondriacal, Andersen was driven by ambitions that, despite the power and brilliance of his work, prevented his ever being satisfied. A signal achievement of Wullschlager&#x2019;s account is to show with great clarity how Andersen&#x2019;s art&#x2014;darker and more diverse than previously recognized&#x2014;emerged directly from the complexities of his life.<br>Jackie Wullschlager has returned to all the original sources in Danish and German, and has followed Andersen&#x2019;s footsteps across Europe. Her evocation of his world&#x2014;Golden Age Copenhagen, the princely courts of Germany and the country villas of the Danish aristocracy, the languid warmth of southern Italy, which released his creativity&#x2014;is unforgettable. She has recovered censored passages from his letters and journals that make plain how his deepest personal relationships, though often frustrated, were with other men. In her words, Andersen emerges in all his fascinating, cross-grained charm and gawkishness, his desperation and his occasional joy, as a writer&#x2014;and a man&#x2014;quite unlike any other.<br></p><p>"In my view it is the best book ever written about Hans Christian Andersen. If someone had asked me a couple of months ago which biography of Andersen was the best I would immodestly have said my own work, but today I would answer that the best book is the one written by Jackie Wullschlager. Not only is is a fuller and more comprehensive biography, but it is the first book ever to place Andersen in a contemporary European tradition and to measure him with a European yardstick." &#x2014;Elias Bredsdorff, Emeritus Professor of Scandinavian Languages at Cambridge <br><br>"[T]his spring, Knopf will publish a biography by Jackie Wullschlager, a writer for the London<i> Financial Times</i>, which may add to the few reliable studies available in English, the most notable of which is Elias Bredsdorff's . . ." &#x2014;Diana and Jeffrey Frank, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"Finely documented and insightful . . .

By the onset of the Depression, the Black population had become primarily urban, transforming individual lives as well as urban experience and culture. The text probes into the relationship of place and time, showing how urban settings became an intrinsic element of African American film as Black people became more firmly rooted in urban spaces and more visible as historical and political subjects. Illuminating the intersections of film, history, politics, and urban discourse, it considers the chief genres of African American and Hollywood narrative film: the black cast musicals of the 1920s and the race films of the early sound era to blaxploitation and the hood films as well as the work of Spike Lee toward the end of the 20th century.</p><p>From Green Pastures to Hoodz"Black City Cinema covers an impressive range of textual and historical ground to reveal "the city" as far more than a frequent setting or theme in Black films. Instead, Paula Massood demonstrates how the urban has functioned as a central organizing trope in the articulation of Black culture, progress, protest and subjectivity. Massood provides a much-needed innovative framework for understanding the complex development of African American film culture." <br>&#x2014;Jacqueline Stewart, Assistant Professor English, Cinema &amp; Media Studies, African &amp; African American Studies, University of Chicago and author of the forthcoming book, Migrating to the Movies: Cinema and Black Urban Modernity <p>"Massood's interpretive discussions of the films are clearly written and convincing; she makes an important original point about the ending of Do the Right Thing, probably the most discussed African American film&#x2014;and ending&#x2014;of all time. She illuminates many other films, about which she writes with easy familiarity and complete authority." <br>&#x2014;J.

The book asks where the disease came from and what effect it had on history, and in so doing it presents some startling new perspectives.<br>Queen Victoria's son, Prince Leopold, died from haemophilia, but no member of the royal family before his generation had suffered from this very visible condition. Medically, there are only two possibilities: either one of Victoria's parents had a 1 in 50,000 random mutation, or Victoria was the illegitimate child of a haemophiliac man.<br>However the haemophilia gene arose, it had a profound effect on history. Two of Victoria's daughters were silent carriers who passed the disease to the Spanish and Russian royal families. The disease played a role in the origin of the Spanish Civil War; and the tsarina's concern over her only son's haemophilia led to the entry of Rasputin into the royal household, contributing directly to the Russian Revolution.<br>Finally, if Queen Victoria was illegitimate, who should have inherited the British throne? The answer is astonishing.</p><p>D. M.

Th e solution to the former was to find a way over, through, or under it. Aircraft in those days were too primitive, too short range, and too underpowered to accomplish this, and Germany lacked the naval strength to force a passage through the blockade. But if Germany could build a fleet of cargo U-boats that were large enough to carry meaningful loads and had the range to make a round trip between Germany and the United States without refueling, the blockade might be successfully broken.<br><br><p>Since the German navy could not cut Britain's supply line to America, another answer lay in sabotaging munitions factories, depots, and ships, as well as infecting horses and mules at the western end of the supply line. German agents, with American sympathizers, successfully carried out more than fifty attacks involving fires and explosions and spread anthrax and glanders on the East Coast before America's entry into the war on 6 April 1917.<br><br></p>Breaking the blockade with a fleet of cargo U-boats provided the lowest risk of drawing America into the war; at the same time, sabotage was incompatible with Germany's diplomatic goal of keeping the United States out of the war. The two solutions were very different, but the fact that both campaigns were run by intelligence agencies--the Etappendienst (navy) and the Geheimdienst (army), through the agency of one man, Paul Hilken, in one American city, Baltimore, make them inseparable. Those solutions created the dichotomy that produced the U-boat <i>Deutschland</i> and the Baltimore Sabotage Cell. Here, Messimer provides the first study of the degree to which U.S. citizens were enlisted in Germany's sabotage operations and debunks many myths that surround the <i>Deutschland</i>.</p><p>Dwight R. Messimer is a U.S. Army veteran and former lecturer in history at California State University-San Jose. He is the author of <i>Find and Destroy: Antisubmarine Warfare in World War I</i> and <i>Verschollen: World War I U-boat Losses</i>. He resides in Northern<br>California."Messimer's passion for the subject, impressive knowledge of WWI submarine engineering, operations and warfare, and talent for crafting nitty-gritty descriptions mixed with insightful analysis and expert technical breakdowns make <i>The Baltimore Sabotage Cell</i> a rich resource brimming with new details and insight about subjects long considered settled." --<b><i>The Submarine Review</i></b><br><br>"Messimer's <i>The Baltimore Sabotage Cell</i> presents a meticulously crafted and well-focused account of Germany's attempt to circumnavigate their limited access to war materials through a novel clandestine exploitation of Maryland's largest industrial center, Baltimore." -- <i><b>U.S. Military History Review</b></i><br><br>"This subtitle of this fascinating book, 'German agents, American traitors and the U-boat <i>Deutschland</i> during World War I', gives an indication of the wide-ranging subject matter.... Messimer tells the story well, using a wide range of sources to create a strong sense of time and place, and investigating the wider issues concerning wartime neutrality that were raised in the USA by <i>Deutschland's</i> visits." -- <b><i>Warship 2017</i></b><br><br>"This exhaustively-researched book adds to a larger narrative about how distant wars can affect our shores. It also shows the ways in which our fellow citizens can turn the places we live and work into the front line."<b><i>--The Daybook</i></b><br><br>"<i>The Baltimore Sabotage Cell</i> is extremely well-researched, with the author making good use of material from captured German naval records, material from the Bureau of Investigation, files of the State Department, newspaper reports, to name just some of the sources; needless to say, he demonstrates as well a thorough mastery of the secondary literature. Strongly recommended because it combines so many different aspects of the war at sea during the First World War into a highly readable and illuminating narrative for both the non-specialist and the naval historian alike."<b><i>--International Journal of Maritime History</i></b><br><br>"Dwight D. Messimer has presented an informative work that offers more than just another illustration of the U-boat war. The hitherto neglected topic of espionage and sabotage - with the broad activities of the other side also awaiting discovery - is presented in this book in an exciting and versatile way." (Translated from German)--<b><i>Milit�rgeschichtlichen Zeitschrift</i></b><br><br>"In these days of increasingly 'multi-cultural' populations in many countries, particularly richer ones, senior politicians and bureaucrats would be well advised to read and carefully digest this book. It is what might be termed a 'cautionary' tale. In any case, it is a fascinating tale and, thinking about it, you could easily see similar things happening in current circumstances where multiple passports are sometimes carried and loyalties divided. This story concerns German/Americans in the period of the First World War before the United States joined the fray. It clearly shows what did go wrong then and what could just as easily happen now. If nothing else, governments and their intelligence services must be eternally vigilant and carefully aware of the activities of those whose loyalties may be divided. It's exciting stuff based on blockade running, espionage and sabotage."<b>--Baird Maritime.com</b><br><br>"Messimer shows a masterful grasp of both American and German archival material and manages to blend the two into a convincing and entertaining tale..." - <b><i>The Historian</i></b><br><br>"Messimer provides a definitive account of <i>U-Deutschland</i>'s career, which, blended with true-life tales of spies and saboteurs, makes for a fascinating read that is utterly engrossing."<b><i>--Warships International Fleet Review</i></b><br><br>"After reading the first few chapters of Dwight Messimer's <i>The Baltimore Sabotage Cell</i>, this reviewer was not sure if it was a spy novel or a work of history. Superbly researched with extensive explanations of context, the book is certainly an important addition to World War I historical scholarship. Few historians possess a command of the sources on these linked subjects, and Messimer skillfully mines German and American documents to support his narrative. His ability to weave important context into the story--such as race relations, diplomatic negotiations, industrial requirements, and American traitors--makes <i>The Baltimore Sabotage Cell</i> a fascinating study."<b><i>--Naval History</i></b></p><h2>BLACK COCKTAIL</h2><p>Black Cocktail (Jonathan Carroll) Paperback</p><p></p><h2>Murder at Drury Lane: Further Adventures of the American Agent in London (Benjamin Franklin Mystery)</h2><p>When a heckler at the Drury Lane Theatre topples to his death, Ben Franklin--in the Pennsylvania colony on business--probes into the theater&#39;s backstage intrigue.</p><p>Set in 1758, the latest well-crafted and entertaining Ben Franklin mystery (after The Case of the Christmas Murder ) finds the Pennsylvania colony's astute agent in England waging a snail-paced bureacratic battle with the Penn family.

But this decorated chef who blazed through the Culinary Institute of America and burst onto New York's fine dining scene -- landing himself on the cover of <em>Gourmet</em> -- actually honed his taste buds on the timeless Italian recipes handed down through his family for generations. <em>Rocco's Italian-American</em> lifts the lid on these age-old meals and shares their secrets, as well as the histories and family traditions that go along with them.</p><p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Rocco's Italian-American</em> is a celebration of the family recipes and experiences of one immigrant family in New York and is sure to become a classic. It is also filled with the wisdom of Rocco's Mamma, who is beloved by the millions who know her from her television appearances.</p><p>Each delicious recipe includes a personal note on the dish, a story associated with it, or a variation preferred by certain relatives. The book is organized by parts of the meal (antipasto, soup, pasta, fish, meat, salad, bread, sweets, and holiday menus). Rocco describes the techniques of the Italian-American kitchen and instructs on the indispensable ingredients, such as tomatoes, olive oil, basil, and beans. The book is lavishly illustrated with (old and new) photos and other artifacts and mementos from his family's treasure chest, including maps, handwritten recipes, and childhood drawings.</p><p>Now for the first time, Rocco shares his favorite family recipes, including:</p><p>--Mamma's Meatballs<br>--Mamma's Frittata<br>--Sardines with Fennel and Orange<br>--Farfalle with Grilled Sausage, Fennel, and Baby Artichoke<br>--Rabbit Cacciatore<br>--Red Snapper and Heirloom Tomatoes Poached in Olive Oil<br>--Asparagus with Besciamella<br>--Poached Cherries with Ricotta Gelato and Toasted Pandoro</p></p><p>Celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito is best known for his short-lived reality TV show The Restaurant, which chronicled the start-up (and disintegration) of DiSpirito's Manhattan dining spot, Rocco's 22nd Street, whose menu was partially devised by his mother Nicolina. Rocco's Italian American offers 150-plus recipes--restaurant-connected dishes like Nicolina's much praised meatballs plus her Eggplant Rollatini and Pizza Fritta, among others. Worthy versions of old favorites include Spaghetti Carbonara, Linguini with Clams, and Stuffed Artichokes. Requiring fewer than ten ingredients, the recipes are as tempting as they are approachable.<p> But recipes are only part of the package. Following the introduction (a bumpy start, as DiSpirito writes that "every American has in common... one �migr� in his family who started it all by coming to America," a statement that Native Americans, among others, will find objectionable) the book offers "Nicolina&#x2019;s Story" and "Rocco&#x2019;s Story," 60-odd pages of detailed reminiscence that some readers will welcome and others find excessive. Photos throughout illustrate the dishes; the chef and his clan (this reader stopped counting shots of DiSpirito at 22); and, unaccountably, portraits of common ingredients like lemons, walnuts, and red pepper flakes, among others.

She drifts between two states of mind and between two islands &#x2018;in a hollow maze&#x2019;, evoking her memories so as to forget nothing and so as to delay the inevitable outcome. Confronted with the pressing immediacy of imminent death, Anguille recounts the story of her whole life in one long, sustained breath, in a series of brief couplets. But what Anguille recounts, in an assured voice which heralds a shipwreck, is also something other than her life &#x2013; something much deeper below the ground, or rather the sea, which has to do with the species and what is immemorial. It is the story of a fight for survival in which everyone becomes a predator. A story told in a single sentence, A Girl Called Eel is a memorial, a reckoning, and a powerful narrative imbued with a prevailing sense of urgency.</p><p>Ali Zamir was born on Anjouan in the Comoros.

His friendships, curiosities and intrigues entangled him in a huge array of different artistic movements, civil wars, Cold War betrayals and, above all, the rediscovery of the history of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Visit him at DrewWillis.com.Grade 6&#x2013;10&#x2014;This book picks up where <i>Sword of Waters</i> (S &amp; S, 2008) leaves off as Prince Edoran runs away from his palace in order to try to save the life of his only true friend, Weasel. Along the way, he joins forces with Arisa, whose mother, the Falcon, is threatening to take over the kingdom. Edoran allows himself to be captured by his former tutor, but escapes with the help of one of the Hidden of the old religion. He is spirited away to a fishing village where he learns that being a pampered prince is not the life he wants. Fate brings all three friends together again, and Edoran has the chance to save his friends and his kingdom, and truly embrace his destiny. This book stands on its own; by the end of the first chapter, the previous events are explained and the current story is satisfying enough to capture readers' attention. At first, the prince is portrayed as a selfish, spoiled brat but his character develops through the trials he encounters and he matures. The plot moves quickly, and though Arisa and Weasel are given little attention here, their personalities were fleshed out in the earlier titles. In the end, all major problems are solved, the prince is ready to accept his life, and plans for a better future for all are in the works.&#x2014;<i>Debra Banna, Sharon Public Library, MA</i> END</p><h2>Pride &amp; Joy</h2><p>SOME DEBTS CAN ONLY BE PAID IN BLOOD Still mourning the loss of his wife, Jimmy Kavanagh lives quietly in the backwoods of New England, raising his devoted daughter and resentful teenage son. But fate has come calling in the worst possible way, as Jimmy&#39;s criminal past threatens to destroy his entire family- raising the spectre of his crushing guilt for an old and awful crime. On the run with a pair of unwanted associates from long ago, Jimmy and his children are pursued by a foe so ruthless and lethal that no one will stand between him and his prey. A showdown is inevitable- but does Jimmy still have what it takes to fight for his family&#39;s survival? And will his horror at his own transgressions consume him long before the predator on his trail? Garth Ennis (Preacher, Crossed, Battlefields) and John Higgins (Judge Dredd, Razorjack, War Story) present a hard-boiled tale of a man at bay- whose only hope of redemption lies on a dark and bloody path. Garth Ennis has been writing comics for over twenty-five years. His credits include Preacher, Hitman, The Boys, Red Team, 303, Rover Red Charlie and the war series Battlefields and War Story. He has also produced successful runs on The Punisher and Fury for Marvel Comics, and recently revived the classic British character Johnny Red. Originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland, he now resides in New York City with his wife, Ruth.</p><p>Garth Ennis is the award-winning writer of Preacher, Hellblazer, War Stories, Hitman, and The Punisher. John Higgins has drawn World Without End, Scarlet Witch, Thing (From Another World), Razorjack and Hellblazer, and was colourist on the groundbreaking Watchmen.This noir tale of parenthood and revenge brings Ennis's talent for dialogue and flair for the grotesque to a decidedly unexpected venue. Jimmy Kavanagh is a long-retired petty criminal and recent widower raising his young daughter and sullen teenage son. He's still mourning his wife and his recently deceased father, whose memory he keeps alive by telling his kids tales of the elder Kavanagh's macho bravery and deeds of chivalry and honor as a pilot. But he's disconnected from his son, who rebels against Jimmy's brand of macho fatherhood, and he seems adrift in the world. That is, until a vicious criminal named Stein returns to exact vengeance for a decades-old double-cross. On the run, Jimmy reminisces about his wife and father's mortality, the stories they told him, and his relationship to his son. Ennis (<i>Preacher</i>) ambitiously attempts to give a sermon on honor, family and love in the context of a family on the run from a psychotic murderer. However, he largely fails to make it work. Jimmy is essentially unsympathetic: his obsession with old-world ethics and his simplistic, black and white outlook make him one-dimensional. Meanwhile, the villain, Stein, is standard issue: capable, we're told again and again, of doing anything, anytime. Without real intrigue behind the protagonist, this work plods along, its thriller plot as listless as its themes. Higgins's art is serviceable but bland and sits on the page, imbuing an already floundering script with little to help it. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is a professor of history at Hamilton College and lives in Clinton, New York.Grade 7-12-- Lively, clear, and thorough, these two volumes effectively capture the American experience in the two World Wars. The text of World War I in particular is nicely balanced. Bosco concisely discusses all aspects of the war, from military logistics and political maneuvering to the horrors of the battlefield. Liberal use of personal narratives and quotes along with battle descriptions and statistics gives readers a vivid sense of life in wartime. By focusing on a few key clashes, like Belleau Wood and the Argonne, the author further enlivens the text. World War II also provides a broad, well-organized overview. Chapters on specific aspects, such as the effect of the war on women and minorities, are smoothly interspersed into the narrative. Less attention is paid to the personal experiences of individuals, though, so this title is not quite as fascinating as World War I . The opening chapter, which describes Szilard and Einstein convincing Roosevelt that an atomic bomb could be made, is more confusing than exciting, and does little to capture readers' interest. Each title includes a few maps and many black-and-white photos that support the text. World War II 's index is thorough, but the one in World War I is less complete. Miguel's Second World War (1987; o.p.) and World War I (1985; o.p., both Silver Burdett), along with Messenger's Second World War (Watts, 1987; o.p.) are adequate resources with color illustrations, but do not match the thorough, readable texts of these newer titles. --Steven Engelfried, Pleasanton Library, CA<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Uneasy Money (Collector&#39;s Wodehouse)</h2><p>The fall brings four more antic novels from comic genius, P. G. Wodehouse. In Picadilly Jim (soon to be a major motion picture), Jimmy Crocker has a scandalous reputation on both sides of the Atlantic and must do an about-face to win back the woman of his dreams. Uneasy Money sees the hard-up Lord Dawlish off to America to make a fortune, while in Cocktail Time events turn on the fate of a filmscript. Spring Fever is a light-hearted comedy involving love and various complications.</p><p><b>P. G. Wodehouse</b> (1881-1975) grew up in England and came to the United States just before World War I, when he married an American. He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.The plot of this amiable romance is secondary to its style. Wodehouse&#39;s masterful language makes high comedy out of situations that would be dull or slapstick in less capable hands. He invites reading aloud, but his effects are fragile, requiring a light, deft touch. Simon Vance&#39;s delivery is understated but satis-factory. He has a pleasant voice and a sympathetic feel for the material. But those who have heard the Bertie Wooster series from the BBC may be left wishing for a less restrained performance. J.N.

Many are species young people are likely to encounter (Canada goose and American robin), while others (the greater roadrunner or the great horned owl) may be more difficult to locate. The illustrations depict the birds in their appropriate habitats. An afterword adds slightly more detailed information about each species, including the sizes of the nine birds. Little else on this subject exists at such a young level and the Sills succeed admirably in offering a basic introduction to the unique characteristics of birds. Minor quibbles: sometimes only the male of the species is shown, at others both sexes are pictured; in neither instance are readers given any aid in determining gender. In spite of these problems, most librarians will find this a priority purchase since it will fill a niche in their collections. --Ellen Fader, Westport Public Library, CT<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>According to the Pattern: Number Six (Classic Series)</h2><p>When Miriam Winthrop becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair with another woman, she strives to become fashionable in order to win back his love</p><p>GRACE LIVINGSTON HILL (1865 1947) is known as the pioneer of Christian romance.

Pam told me about her twenty-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who was suffering from a fatal degenerative neurological disease. Pam phoned to ask if I would be willing to be the keynote speaker at an A-T fund-raiser she was hosting. I had never heard of the disease. Pam told me ataxia- telangiectasia is a very rare disease affecting only three Caucasian children in a million. Pam said she was inspired by<br>a book I had written.<br><br>In 1999 I spent my days writing, delivering lectures around the country, teaching spiritual counseling at a local rabbinical seminary, and together with my husband, Rob, raising our two children, Adi, who was five, and Noa, who was three. I had been a congregational rabbi for seven years, but I chose to leave the congregation so that I could have more flexible hours for writing, for teaching, and for mothering. When I got Pam&#x2019;s call I was feverishly at work on a new book of prayers, and life was good. I had a wonderful husband and two healthy children.<br><br>Of course, I agreed to speak at the A-T fund-raiser, and Pam and I set a time for us all to get together for lunch at a local restaurant. I had no idea what to expect. I didn&#x2019;t know what a young woman with A-T would look like. On the appointed afternoon a van pulled up in front of the restaurant and Rebecca&#x2019;s father, George, wheeled her up to the table beside me. She was quite beautiful, with straight shiny dark brown hair, ivory skin, and a glowing smile. When I asked Rebecca about school it was hard to understand what she was saying because her speech was so slurred. I could tell she was getting frustrated because I kept turning to her parents for a translation. Her body had been ravaged by this cruel disease. I could see Rebecca was angry. She was angry to have to be so dependent upon her parents at an age when she needed to rebel and carve out her own identity. All her friends were driving, were at college, were dancing at parties. And she was fighting for life. The pain in her parents&#x2019; faces was palpable. Pam said to me, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have bad days. Every day with Rebecca is a good day.&#x201d; Yes, Rebecca was a gift. And I&#x2019;m certain Pam treasured every moment with her. And I could see the sadness behind Pam&#x2019;s smile. Why should such a blessed child have to suffer so?<br><br>Rebecca&#x2019;s father, George, ran a very successful real-estate financing company. He was a self-made man who was used to getting what he wanted. The tragedy was, he had made enough money to give Rebecca anything her heart desired, but this man who was larger than life was helpless to cure his child. There was no cure for A-T. No treatment.&nbsp; A&nbsp;diagnosis of A-T was a certain death sentence. Period. George and Pam&#x2019;s response to all their feelings of helplessness was to create a foundation to raise money for A-T research. Through their foundation they had already raised millions. Yet there was no cure or treatment in sight.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t begin to imagine the torment Rebecca and her parents were living with daily. And the hope. Rebecca was considered something of a miracle in the world of A-T. Most kids with A-T don&#x2019;t make it out of their teens.<br><br>On the day of the fund-raiser there must have been seven hundred people gathered together in support of Rebecca and her family. Every speaker talked about hope for finding a cure. They showed a video about Rebecca. I saw her walking around happily as a toddler and then we all watched scenes of her gradual decline, scenes of her bravery and<br>her struggles for life. We watched her riding her horse with such joy. Then I got up and spoke about Rebecca&#x2019;s courage and her family&#x2019;s dedication to finding a cure for this horrible disease. That very week was Rebecca&#x2019;s twenty-first birthday and Pam asked me to bless her. Rebecca slowly came up on stage all by herself with crutches. There was<br>such determination and joy that shone through her eyes. I closed my eyes, put my hands on her head, and blessed her with a birthday blessing. I prayed for Rebecca&#x2019;s health, for her strength; I prayed for a cure. I could hear the weeping in the room.<br><br>What did I believe? Did I believe in a God who could cure Rebecca? Did I believe God would miraculously undo what nature and genes had done? No. Not exactly. But I wanted to believe it. I remembered listening once to a preacher on the radio who said, &#x201c;If God says you can catch a whale, then start cracking out the tartar sauce!&#x201d; I prayed for that kind of faith in God&#x2019;s supernatural powers and at the same time I prayed for Rebecca&#x2019;s doctors. I hoped scientists could<br>learn to correct the problem, treat the problem, cure the problem.<br><br>A scientist named Dr. Becket then took the stage to receive an award for his incredible breakthroughs in A-T research. He played a movie about his lab and the amazing advances he was making with the help of Rebecca&#x2019;s family. He said there was a blessing in Rebecca having A-T because her illness had led to the funding of such important research. I gasped when he spoke those words. As far as I was concerned, there was nothing good about Rebecca&#x2019;s A-T. No blessing in it.<br><br>I felt so sorry for Rebecca and her family. And yes, I felt so blessed and relieved that my own children were perfectly healthy. <br><br>I came home that day from the fund-raiser and wrapped my arms around both my kids and squeezed them with so much gratitude for all our blessings.<br><br>Two years passed.

He served in World War II from 1940 until 1945, entering the army as a private and emerging with the rank of captain. He began writing for his living in 1949 after spending two years in the Arctic. Since 1949 he has lived in or visited almost every part of Canada and many other lands, including the distant regions of Siberia. He remains an inveterate traveller with a passion for remote places and peoples. He has twenty-five books to his name, which have been published in translations in over twenty languages in more than sixty countries. They include such internationally known works as <i>People of the Deer</i>, <i>The Dog Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Be</i>, <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>, <i>Westviking</i>, <i>The Boat Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Float</i>, <i>Sibir</i>, <i>A Whale for the Killing</i>, <i>The Snow Walker</i>, <i>And No Birds Sang</i>, and <i>Virunga: The Passion of Dian Fossey</i>. His short stories and articles have appeared in <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and other magazines.In April 1985, en route to a publicity tour in the U.S., Mowat was barred from crossing the border. The Canadian author of Never Cry Wolf and other books on wildlife and conservation was mystified, for U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials refused to reveal the grounds for their action. Mowat waged a war of publicity, and it was through press accounts, rather than being informed directly, that he learned the reasons (relating to his leftist and environmentalist sympathies) for his exclusion. His brief day-by-day account of the affair, written with charm and irony, relies heavily on quotes from newspaper articles, editorials and letters of support from Canadians and U.S. citizensthe latter of whom surprised him, since he had thought of Americans as toeing their government's "arrogant, imperialistic" line. This "discovery" of Mowat's may not be news on this side of the border, but it provides an encouraging conclusion to a maddening tale of official high-handedness.

Ringer of pulling punches. But, then again, as the author of such previous bestsellers as <i>Winning Through Intimidation</i> and <i>Looking Out for No. 1</i>, it should come as no surprise that this writer calls it like he sees it. Unfortunately, in <i>Getting What You Want</i>, Ringer seems more interested in persuading readers not to like many of the things--and people--he doesn't, as opposed to providing a road map to rational living, as promised by the subtitle.<p> Ringer begins by defining a rational life as "a life guided by conscious effort to make rational decisions that result in an individual's getting what he wants over the long term, so long as actions stemming from those decisions do not involve the use of force or fraud against anyone else." He then divides the book into seven chapters, each focusing on one of his seven principles of rational living, ranging from "Base Your Actions on Truth" (principle 1) to "Avoid Those Who Drain Your Personal Resources" (principle 4) to "Learn from Bad Breaks, and Move On" (principle 7). Ringer repeatedly hammers home the theme that we live in an increasingly values-challenged, irrational world (hence, the need to be rational), offering up examples at every possible opportunity.</p><p> Consider Ringer's thoughts on Elvis Presley, who, he argues, exemplifies the need of so many people to idolize celebrities--"a contagious strain of self-delusion" that is a direct assault on principle 1: </p><blockquote>He never wrote a song, couldn't play a musical instrument (other than barely being able to pluck around on his guitar prop), couldn't act, and put himself into an early grave with a remarkable lack of self discipline that ballooned his weight and saturated his body with harmful substances. To his credit, he never championed a cause; in fact, he never claimed to believe in anything. </blockquote><p> Bill Clinton, criminal defense attorneys, all political causes (including the American Revolution), the rapper Ice Cube, O.J. Simpson, and McDonald's founder Ray Kroc don't fare much better in the author's opinion, each being an affront to one or more of the seven principles. </p><p> What does all this have to do with getting what you want? Not much, but Ringer, at least, starts off well by noting in his opening paragraph that there have been "thousands of books written on the subject of achieving happiness, each offering the author's views on how to bring about that much-sought-after, but very elusive, state of mind." Want it or not, here's one more. <i>--Patrick Jennings</i></p>Real-estate broker turned self-publisher turned mega-bestselling author, Robert J.

Throughout the collection, Grossman highlights distinctive features of Marx&#x2019;s economic theory by contrasting it with the views of his forerunners, from Adam Smith to Jean Charles Sismondi. He then moves on to show how many Marxist economists import faulty assumptions from mainstream economics into their analyses, and in the process provides a unique overview of the major debates among Marxists over politics and economics between Marx&#x2019;s death and the rise of Fascism in Germany.<br><br>Rick Kuhn&#x2019;s invaluable introduction provides vital context for understanding the development of Grossman&#x2019;s ideas and makes the case for their continued relevance to contemporary activists.<br></p><p><b>Henryk Grossman</b> (1881&#x2013;1950) was the most important Marxist economist of the Twentith Century.

Now, Sandler returns to the high seas, this time for an in-depth look at the Atlantic, those who sailed across it, and the world-shifting transformations wrought by those explorers and travelers.<br>Since 300 B.C.E., the Atlantic has served as the corridor for fundamental exchanges of peoples and technologies, a pathway for the transfer of ideas and cultures that defined and challenged communities across wide spans of time and space. This, the first illustrated and comprehensive history of the Atlantic World, is at the forefront of an exciting new wave of study in universities and think tanks. Atlantic History is an increasingly dynamic field of scholarship based on the notion that the Americas, Africa, and Europe have composed a regional system from the late 15th century to the present.<br>Sandler explores the historical, socioeconomic, political, scientific, and cultural developments that occurred throughout this important region and that shaped the modern world to this very day. They include everything from exploration and discovery, the dissemination of ideas, and the growth of global commerce, and the fall of imperialism.<br>Lavishly illustrated with exquisite antique maps, period paintings and engravings, documents, political cartoons, and photographs, this unique volume is an engaging read sure to appeal to audiences everywhere.</p><p>This history of the Atlantic world is packed with paintings, maps both ancient and modern, and photographs. Prolific historian and Emmy-winning TV writer Sandler points out that scholars have only recently focused on the Americas, Europe and Africa together as a thriving regional system connected by the great ocean. The book begins in the ancient world, when sailors ventured surprisingly far out into the Atlantic with no navigational instruments. The narrative pace picks up after Columbuss voyages, with beautiful maps and images of the early explorations. As history, there is little new in the chapters on the American, French and Industrial revolutions and the world wars, but the book shines in depicting the ships that traveled the ocean, their technical progress and voyages, the massive movement of immigrants and slaves, and todays continuing exploration of the Atlantic. While the writing is a cut above that of the usual coffee-table book, it's the illustrations that really stand out, so readers will have a thoroughly satisfying time just poring over the 480 color illustrations and their extensive captions. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.Kindergarten-Grade 4-Though Freeman died in 1978, his love for storytelling and, in particular, his love for music live on through this previously unpublished tale of determination personified in the character of a praying mantis. The lonely insect longs to join other creatures in making music, but lacks the chirp of the crickets or the croak of the frogs. He also fails at building his own instruments, as a reed made into a flute makes no noise, the flower of a trumpet vine does not blow, and his "snippy" claws break the strings of a twig-and-cobweb harp. Finally, an intelligent and observant spider agrees to help him, if he promises not to eat her for dinner. An artistic collaboration is born as Debby Webster spins web and other objects into an instrument that will bring music into Manuelo's life. The rich pastel illustrations present the world of the resolute Manuelo as the "playing mantis" introduces various instruments to readers. With his stick-thin limbs, the insect makes a graceful figure as he plays his homemade cello. The tiny white spider perfectly reflects the delicate nature of the web she spins. With characters that are empathetic and intrepid, this story makes a good model for encouraging youngsters to persevere when they encounter difficulties. A fine choice for all libraries, this book will be of special interest to young musicians.<i>-Mary Elam, Forman Elementary School, Plano, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author suggests that both future worlds coexist in their own dimensions, and we choose by our vibratory levels which world we will inhabit.</p><p>Rama, a 21st-century Buddha, who is imprisoned in a psychically impenetrable prison in the Swiss Alps, is the object of intense scientific scrutiny.

What of the promised messiahs that were late for the millennium party? And what of peoples&#x2019; hopes and dreams that were crushed underfoot, like grapes into smelly wine?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the children in The Village of the Dammed were feared for their collective psychic abilities, the new generation in Nelson&#x2019;s book is equally misunderstood.&nbsp; Matrix of the Gods paints a stunning picture of the future of our species and is highly recommended.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Magical Blend <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever felt trapped in a mindset that limited your view of yourself&#x2014;that focused on the day to day practical concerns to the point where your inner self and its sense of wonder seem to have died, or to be on the brink of annihilation? In this book, author John Nelson expresses this feeling in a way that reaches into us and frees the wonder and aims at restoring our aliveness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrix of the Gods is set sixty years into the future, circa 2050.&nbsp; The earth has suffered a catastrophic ecological collapse, and its greatly diminished population is herded into large cities under glass beaded &#x201c;environ&#x201d; canopies, controlled and pacified by subliminal programming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel&#x2019;s vision of our future selves offers us a wake-up call.&nbsp; As we become more cut off from our natural inner selves, we become more and more (in spirit) like Nelson&#x2019;s 21st century humans&#x2014;thin, attenuated versions of full-blooded humans.&nbsp; The story moves forward with hope, when in an almost collective response to their world and their feeble consciousness, some children are being born in a buddha-state.&nbsp; This alarms 21st century politicians, who fear that these new beings&#x2019; expansive consciousness will threaten their political power&#x2014;power that relies on total mind control of the population.&nbsp; (It would appear that the author was influenced by Orwell&#x2019;s 1984.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future scientists have discovered that consciousness is contagious, and what they fear more than&nbsp; a new idea or a charismatic leader, is pure elevated consciousness itself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tapping into today&#x2019;s &#x201c;green&#x201d; consciousness, the author revolves his plot around the imprisonment of Rama, the &#x201c;green guru&#x201d; who has triggered the birth of the children.&nbsp; What I most enjoyed were the extensive interviews with Rama in prison as he tells of his journey into the natural state of being.&nbsp; Rama&#x2019;s dialogues, telling the reader of his personal journey into the buddha state (enlightenment) challenge us to expand our awareness of ourselves and our planet and truly leap into a new world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the science fiction format, Nelson essentially is exploring Eastern philosophy with Rama and his &#x201c;buddhafield,&#x201d; which like an archetype, grows stronger with the entrance of each person into this state of consciousness.&nbsp; As we join the author on his exploration, we are led to discover the ultimate transformative truth&#x2014;that we create and recreate the world around us through consciousness.&nbsp; This I feel is the value of Matrix of the Gods&#x2014;a powerful timely way to internalize a message that the sages have passed down through the ages: &#x201c;Change yourself and you change the world.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--New Frontier <br></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary Summer Rain has been quoted as saying of John Nelson that he &#x201c;. . . is a dreamer of prophetic dreams,&#x201d; and this is a very prophetic statement when understood in relation to this, Nelson&#x2019;s latest work of fiction.&nbsp; As our world teeters in a precarious position between the possibilities of a new millennium of spiritual enlightenment and the alternate possibility of apocalyptic destruction, Nelson helps us see that our collective consciousness is determining the eventual reality.&nbsp; The future hinges on a real &#x201c;toss-up,&#x201d; and that toss-up of consciousness, along with different resulting possibilities, are the focus of Nelson&#x2019;s new novel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a very near total catastrophic ecological collapse, the earth&#x2019;s population greatly diminished, [governments] have herded the few people left into glass-canopied mega cities where subliminal programming controls and pacifies them.&nbsp; Rama, the &#x201c;green guru,&#x201d; is imprisoned in the Swiss Alps by the &#x201c;World Council&#x201d; which fears that Rama will alter world consciousness and place their future and well-being in a precarious position.&nbsp; Then, Zita Hiller, a reporter dispatched to discredit Rama, instead becomes involved in a race to ensure the birth of an evolved species of children before the World Council can locate and destroy them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, future scientists have discovered that consciousness is contagious.&nbsp; The World Council fears pure, elevated consciousness more than anything, thus setting the stage for a confrontation, a final showdown, between World Councilites and the faction wishing to raise consciousness and finally set it free to shift into a wholly new, fourth dimensional world. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--New Age Retailer</p></p><h2>Palestine Papers: 1917-1922: Seeds of Conflict</h2><p>Brings the forgotten pages of history back to passionate life. Doreen Ingrams has sieved through secret British cabinet documents, Foreign and War office memoranda and their cryptic annotations, to observe the creation of a Zionist homeland out of the Palestine Protectorate. Cock-up or conspiracy? You decide. Read Curzon, Churchill, Weizmann, Balfour, T.E. Lawrence, and others in their own words.</p><p>Doreen Ingrams (1906-1997) was a highly unconventional historian. The youngest child of a Liberal Home Secretary, she ran away from home to become an actress. After six fulfilling yeatrs of Shakespearean leads, she fell in love with young colonial official. Bored rigid by the society of other colonial administrators in Mauritius, Zanzibar and Yemen, she survived by immersing herself in the languages, politics and cultures around her, educating herself like those other pioneering, female, scholar-travellers of the Middle East. She and her equally distinguished husband, Harold Ingrams, were jointly awarded gold medals by the Royal Geographical Society, The Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Central Asian Society.</p><h2>Shame</h2><p>Omar Khayyam Shakil had three mothers who shared everything. They shared the symptoms of pregnancy, they shared the son that they all claim to have borne on the same night. Raised at their six breasts, Omar&#39;s mothers teach him to live a life without shame. And it is training that proves very useful when he leaves his mothers&#39; fortress and makes the fateful mistake of falling in love. For he finds himself an unwitting player in an ongoing duel between the families of two men - one a celebrated wager of war, the other a debauched lover of pleasure - living in a world caught between honour and humiliation, where a moment of shame could prove fatal.</p><p>" <b>Shame</b> is and is not about Pakistan, that invented, imaginary country... The theme is shame and shamelessness, born from the violence which is modern history.

Set in a country "not quite Pakistan," the story centers around the families of two men -- one a celebrated warrior, the other, a debauched playboy engaged in a protracted duel that is played out in the political landscape of their country. <b>Shame</b> is a tour de force and a fitting predecessor to the author's legendary novel, <b>The Satanic Verses</b>.</p><h2>Growing Up Aboriginal in Australia</h2><p>What is it like to grow up Aboriginal in Australia?

They&#x2019;re too beautiful to live, much too beautiful.<br><br>&#x2014;Charles Dickens, Nicholas Nickleby<br><br>One<br><br>They say that every road leads home if you care to go there. I long for home, for the town of Pico Mundo and the desert in which it blooms, but the roads that I take seem to lead me to one hell after another.<br><br>In the front passenger seat of the Mercedes, through the side window, I watch the stars, which appear to be fixed but in fact are ever moving and perpetually receding. They seem eternal, but they are only suns that will burn out one day.<br><br>When she was just a child, Stormy Llewellyn lost her mother, Cassiopeia. I lost Stormy when she and I were twenty. One of the northern constellations is called Cassiopeia. No group of distant suns is named for Stormy.<br><br>I can see Cassiopeia&#x2019;s namesake high in the night, but I can see Stormy only in my memory, where she remains as vivid as any living person I might meet.<br><br>The stars and everything else in the universe began with the big bang, which was when time also began. Some place existed before the universe, exists outside of it now, and will exist when the universe collapses back upon itself. In that mysterious place, outside of time, Stormy waits for me. Only through time can time be conquered, and the way forward is the only way back to my girl.<br><br>Yet again, because of recent events, I have been called a hero, and again I don&#x2019;t feel like one.<br><br>Annamaria insists that mere hours earlier, I saved entire cities, sparing many hundreds of thousands from nuclear terrorism. Even if that is most likely true, I feel as though, in the process, I have forfeited a piece of my soul.<br><br>To foil the conspiracy, I killed four men and one young woman. They would have killed me if given a chance, but the honest claim of self-defense doesn&#x2019;t make the killing lie less heavily upon my heart.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t born to kill. Like all of us, I was born for joy. This broken world, however, breaks most of us, grinding relentlessly on its metaled tracks.<br><br>Leaving Magic Beach, fearing pursuit, I had driven the Mercedes that my friend Hutch Hutchison lent me. After several miles, when the memories of recent violence overwhelmed me, I stopped along the side of the road and changed places with Annamaria.<br><br>Now, behind the wheel, by way of consolation, she says, &#x201c;Life is hard, young man, but it was not always so.&#x201d;<br><br>I have known her less than twenty-four hours. And the longer I know her, the more she mystifies me. She is perhaps eighteen, almost four years younger than me, but she seems much older. The things she says are often cryptic, though I feel that the meaning would be clear to me if I were wiser than I am.<br><br>Plain but not unattractive, petite, with flawless pale skin and great dark eyes, she seems to be about seven months pregnant. Any girl her age, in her condition, alone in the world as she is, ought to be anxious, but she is calm and confident, as if she believes that she lives a charmed life&#x2014;which often seems to be the case.<br><br>We are not linked romantically. After Stormy, there can be none of that for me. Although we do not speak of it, between us there is a kind of love, platonic but deep, strangely deep considering that we have known each other such a short while. I have no sister, although perhaps this is how I would feel if I were Annamaria&#x2019;s brother.<br><br>Magic Beach to Santa Barbara, our destination, is a four-hour drive, a straight shot down the coast. We have been on the road less than two hours when, two miles past the picturesque town of Moonlight Bay and Fort Wyvern&#x2014;an army base that has been closed since the end of the Cold War&#x2014;she says, &#x201c;Do you feel it pulling at you, odd one?&#x201d;<br><br>My name is Odd Thomas, which I explained in previous volumes of this memoir, which I will no doubt explain again in future volumes, but which I will not explain here, in this detour from the main arc of my journey. Until Annamaria, only Stormy called me &#x201c;odd one.&#x201d;<br><br>I am a short-order cook, though I haven&#x2019;t worked in a diner since I left Pico Mundo eighteen months earlier. I miss the griddle, the deep fryer. A job like that is centering. Griddle work is Zen.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you feel it pulling?&#x201d; she repeats. &#x201c;Like the gravity of the moon pulling tides through the sea.&#x201d;<br><br>Curled on the backseat, the golden retriever, Raphael, growls as if in answer to Annamaria&#x2019;s question. Our other dog, the white German shepherd named Boo, of course makes no sound.<br><br>Slumped in my seat, head resting against the cool glass of the window in the passenger door, half hypnotized by the patterns in the stars, I feel nothing unusual until Annamaria asks her question. But then I sense unmistakably that something in the night summons me, not to Santa Barbara but elsewhere.<br><br>I have a sixth sense with several facets, the first of which is that I can see the spirits of the lingering dead, who are reluctant to move on to the Other Side. They often want me to bring justice to their murderers or to help them find the courage to cross from this world to the next. Once in a while, I have a prophetic dream. And since leaving Pico Mundo after Stormy&#x2019;s violent death, I seem to be magnetized and drawn toward places of trouble, to which some Power wishes me to travel.<br><br>My life has mysterious purpose that I don&#x2019;t understand, and day by day, conflict by conflict, I learn by going where I have to go.<br><br>Now, to the west, the sea is black and forbidding except for a distorted reflection of the icy moon, which on those waters melts into a long silvery smear.<br><br>In the headlights, the broken white line on the blacktop flashes toward the south.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you feel it pulling?&#x201d; she asks again.<br><br>The inland hills are dark, but ahead on the right, pools of warm light welcome travelers at a cluster of enterprises that are not associated with a town.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Those lights.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as I speak, I know we will find death in this place. But there is no turning back. I am compelled to act in these cases. Besides, this woman seems to have become my backup conscience, gently reminding me what is the right thing to do when I falter.<br><br>A hundred yards past a sign that promises food fuel lodging, an exit from the highway looms. She takes it fast, but with confidence and skill.<br><br>As we reach the foot of the ramp and halt at a stop sign, I say, &#x201c;You feel it, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not gifted as you are, odd one. I don&#x2019;t feel such things. But I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What I need to know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is what is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what is this what-is that you know?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiles. &#x201c;I know what matters, how it all works, and why.&#x201d;<br><br>The smile suggests she enjoys tweaking me by being enigmatic&#x2014;although there is no meanness in her teasing.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t believe there is any deception in her, either. I am convinced she always speaks the truth. And she does not, as it might seem, talk in code. She speaks the truth profoundly but perhaps as poets speak it: obliquely, employing paradox, symbols, metaphors.<br><br>I met her on a public pier in Magic Beach. I know nothing of substance about her past. I don&#x2019;t even know her last name; she claims that she doesn&#x2019;t have one. When I first saw Annamaria, I sensed that she harbored extraordinary secrets and that she needed a friend. She has accepted my friendship and has given hers to me. But she holds tightly to her secrets.<br><br>The stop sign is at an intersection with a two-lane county road that parallels the state highway. She turns left and drives toward a service station that is open even in these lonely hours before dawn, offering a discount brand of gasoline and a mechanic on call.<br><br>Instead of a double score of gasoline pumps that a truck stop might offer, this station provides just four pumps on two islands. At the moment, none is in use.<br><br>Dating from the 1930s, the flat-roofed white-stucco building features Art Deco details, including a cast-plaster frieze revealed by lights in the overhanging cornice. The frieze depicts stylized cars and borzoi hounds racing perpetually, painted in yellows, grays, and royal blue.<br><br>The place is quaint, a little architectural gem from an age when even humble structures were often artfully designed and embellished. It is impeccably maintained, and the warm light in the panes of the French windows no doubt looks welcoming to an average traveler, although nothing here charms me.<br><br>Intuition sometimes whispers to me but is seldom loud. Now it is equivalent to a shout, warning me that although this place might be pleasing to the eye, under the attractive surface lies something terrible.<br><br>In the backseat, Raphael growls low again.<br><br>I say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like this place.&#x201d;<br><br>Annamaria is unperturbed. &#x201c;If you liked it, young man, there&#x2019;d be no reason for us to be here.&#x201d;<br><br>A tow truck stands beside the station. One of the two bay doors is raised, and even at this hour, a mechanic works on a Jaguar.<br><br>A nattily dressed man with a mane of silver hair&#x2014;perhaps the owner of the Jaguar, recently rescued from the side of the highway&#x2014;stands watching the mechanic and sipping coffee from a paper cup. Neither of them looks up as we cruise past.<br><br>Three eighteen-wheelers&#x2014;a Mack, a Cascadia, and a Peterbilt&#x2014;are parked on the farther side of the station. These well-polished rigs appear to belong to owner-operators, because they have custom paint jobs, numerous chrome add-ons, double-hump fenders, and the like.<br><br>Beyond the trucks, a long low building appears to be a diner, in a style matching the service sta- tion. The eatery announces itself with rooftop red- and-blue neon: HARMONY CORNER / open 24 hours. Two pickups and two SUVs are in front of the diner, and when Annamaria parks there, the Mercedes&#x2019; headlights brighten a sign informing us that for cottage rentals we should inquire within.<br><br>The third and final element of this enterprise, ten cottages, lies past the restaurant. The units are arranged in an arc, sheltered under mature New Zealand Christmas trees and graceful acacias softly but magically lighted. It appears to be a motor court from the early days of automobile travel, a place where Humphrey Bogart might hide out with Lauren Bacall and eventually end up in a gunfight with Edward G. Robinson.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll have two cottages available,&#x201d; Annamaria predicts as she switches off the engine. When I start to open my door, she says, &#x201c;No. Wait here. We&#x2019;re not far from Magic Beach. There may be an all-points bulletin out for you.&#x201d;<br><br>After thwarting delivery of the four thermo- nuclear devices to terrorists, mere hours earlier, I&#x2019;d called the FBI office in Santa Cruz to report that they could find four bomb triggers among the used clothing in a Salvation Army collection bin in Magic Beach. They know I&#x2019;m not one of the conspirators, but they are eager to talk with me anyway. As far as the FBI is concerned, this is prom night, and they don&#x2019;t want me leaving the dance with anyone but them.<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know my name,&#x201d; I assure Annamaria. &#x201c;And they don&#x2019;t have my picture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They might have a good description.

The sleeves are too long, hanging past the first knuckles of her fingers. She looks like a waif.<br><br>People warm to her on sight, and the trust that she inspires in everyone is uncanny. They aren&#x2019;t likely to turn her away just because she lacks a credit card and ID.<br><br>In Magic Beach, she had been living rent-free in an apartment above a garage. She says that although she never asks for anything, people give her what she needs. I have seen that this is true.<br><br>She claims there are people who want to kill her, but she seems to have no fear of them, whoever they might be. I have yet to see proof that she fears anything.<br><br>Earlier, she asked if I would die for her. Without hesitation, I said that I would&#x2014;and meant it.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t understand either my reaction to her or the source of her power. She is something other than she appears to be.

Or maybe not.<br><br>Long ago, I learned that, even with my sixth sense, I am not a singularity and that the world is a place of layered wonders beyond counting. Most people unconsciously blind themselves to the true nature of existence, because they fear knowing that this world is a place of mystery and meaning. It&#x2019;s immeasurably easier to live in a world that&#x2019;s all surfaces, that means nothing and demands nothing of you.<br><br>Because I so love this wondrous world, I am by nature optimistic and of good humor. My friend and mentor Ozzie Boone says buoyancy is one of my better qualities. However, as though to warn that excess buoyancy might lead to carelessness, he sometimes reminds me that shit, too, floats.<br><br>But on my worst days, which are rare and of which this is one, I can get down so low that the bottom seems to be where I belong. I don&#x2019;t even want to look for a way up.

Sparkling clean. And the food smells good. It&#x2019;s called Harmony Corner because it&#x2019;s all owned and operated by the Harmony family, quite a big clan judging by what Holly Harmony told me. She&#x2019;s the lone waitress this shift.&#x201d;<br><br>Annamaria starts the Mercedes and drives to the motor court, repeatedly glancing at me, which I pretend not to notice.<br><br>After she parks between two cottages and switches off the engine and the headlights, she says, &#x201c;Melancholy can be seductive when it&#x2019;s twined with self-pity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pity myself,&#x201d; I assure her.<br><br>&#x201c;Then what would you call it? Perhaps self-sympathy?&#x201d;<br><br>I decide not to answer.<br><br>&#x201c;Self-compassion?&#x201d; she suggests. &#x201c;Self-commiseration?

His most popular works are the well-known Dune books: Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, and the extraordinary bestseller God Emperor of Dune. He wrote more than twenty other works of fiction and nonfiction, including a book on home computers, before his death in 1986. Scott Brick has recorded over five hundred audiobooks, has won over forty AudioFile Earphones Awards, and has twice received Audie Awards for his work on the Dune series.

A mixture of ecstatic expression and earnest piety, metaphysical nuance and embodied spirituality, it is far more than the stereotype of a supernatural sideshow. In this presumably secular era, Pentecostalism continues to grow, adapting to a diverse religious marketplace and becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Originally an American phenomenon, it is now a globe-spanning religion.<br><br> In this book, Arlene M. S�nchez Walsh provides a thematic overview of Pentecostalism in America, covering Pentecostal faith and practices, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, trends and offshoots, and the future of American Pentecostalism. She also considers Pentecostalism&#x2019;s spiritual lineages, examining colorful leaders, ordinary adherents, and prominent outliers, as well as its deep roots in American popular culture. She examines Pentecostalism as a narrative performance, aiming to explain what Pentecostalism is through the experiences and stories of its adherents. S�nchez Walsh treats this Christian movement with the critical eye it has often lacked, and places it in context within the larger narrative of American religious history. An indispensable introduction to Pentecostalism, rich with insights for experienced readers, <i>Pentecostals in America</i> is an essential study of a vibrant religious movement.</p><p>Arlene M. S�nchez Walsh is associate professor of religious studies at Azusa Pacific University. She is the author of the award-winning <i>Latino Pentecostal Identity: Evangelical Faith, Self, and Society</i> (Columbia, 2003).<i>Pentecostals in America</i> is a lively thematic exploration of Pentecostal believers across the twentieth century and into our own time. With a keen ear and an acute sensitivity toward the stories that tie worshipers to this eclectic and powerfully embodied tradition, Arlene M. S�nchez Walsh insightfully scrutinizes the faith and practices of Pentecostal women and men. She attends closely to a diverse cast of noted leaders as well as contemporary outliers who stretch the boundaries of the tradition, analyzing important factors such as gender and sexuality ideals, popular culture, and race and ethnicity. A smart, compelling, and entertaining analysis of a homegrown American religion that has become a global force. (R. Marie Griffith, John C. Danforth Distinguished Professor in the Humanities, Washington University in St. Louis)<br><br>'Pentecostals tell great stories' and so does Arlene M. S�nchez Walsh in this marvelous new addition to the Columbia Contemporary American Religion Series. Combining empathy with insight and deep scholarship with dramatic flair, S�nchez Walsh offers a well-rounded, richly textured picture that tells us a good deal about America as well as about Pentecostalism. This book will engage students, inspire scholars, and advance understanding of the power and complexity of religion in American life. (Amanda Porterfield, author of <i>Corporate Spirit: Religion and the Rise of the Modern Corporation</i>)<br><br>In <i>Penteacostals in America</i>, Arlene M. S�nchez Walsh explores, describes, and interprets the almost infinitely varied and complex world of American Pentecostalism. The result is an impressionist painting of Pentecostalism in America, beautifully colored and bursting with vivid description and stimulating interpretations, both useful and delightfully interesting to read. (Paul Harvey, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs)<br><br>Arlene M. S�nchez Walsh&#x2019;s book <i>Pentecostals in America</i> is a fresh take on the traditional history of the American Pentecostal movement. The book is thematic, rather than chronological, and explores issues around gender, sexuality, race, music, fame, and theological innovation by using snapshots of Pentecostal lives in order to excavate the complexities of the religious tradition. By focusing on particular people, Sanchez-Walsh puts well known Pentecostals including William Seymour, Charles Fox Parham, Aimee Semple McPherson, and A. A. Allen in conversation with more controversial figures such as Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Juanita Bynum, and the prosperity preacher Joel Osteen. She weaves her ethnographic findings together with historical and biographical research, thus enlivening the narrative with her wry, funny voice and personal observations. S�nchez Walsh writes with verve and the careful observation of one who has studied the movement for a long time. (Angela Tarango, Trinity University)<br><br>This exciting project offers a compelling take on Pentecostalism&#x2019;s history in the U.S., and is an eminently readable introduction to the subject that should be accessible to both students and scholars alike. By arguing that Pentecostalism, as a social and religious movement, is quintessentially American, S�nchez Walsh highlights Pentecostalism&#x2019;s flexibility and improvisational nature. (Phillip Luke Sinitiere, College of Biblical Studies)<br><br>For all readers, the book provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to piece together the impact that Pentecostalism&#x2015;because of its fragmentation and the entrepreneurialism of its leaders&#x2015;has had on American history, popular culture and other aspects of American life. (Ethan Sharp <i>Western Folklore</i>)<br><br>This is an absorbing study of US American Pentecostals that is easy to read, full of surprises, and sometimes shocks. Although it is certainly an academic study, well referenced in endnotes, it reads as a series of personal vignettes. (Allan H. Anderson <i>Journal of Church and State</i>)<br><br>This book can provide a variety of readers with a useful introduction to American Pentecostalism. The book could be effectively assigned to undergraduate students. It is short enough to fit into a syllabus in a survey course, but also wide-ranging enough to be used as a textbook in a course focused on Pentecostalism. The book may also provide a useful entry point for scholars in related fields looking to familiarize themselves with Pentecostalism. . . . Clergy and seminarians outside the Pentecostal tradition may also find the book valuable as an aid to understanding their fellow Christians and strengthening ecumenical bonds.

Progressive Repertoire is the first English language method for beginning Double Bass to incorporate the innovative division of the Bass fingerboard into six positions, developed by renowned French bassist Fran�ois Rabbath in his three volume Nouvelle Technique de la Contrebasse. Mr. Vance has created a method that introduces these revolutionary ideas in a progressive manner using familiar folk and classical material to produce studies and pieces that will appeal to novice Basses of all ages. In addition, a Compact Disc or MP3 download is included with each of the primary books containing all the music performed by Fran�ois Rabbath, with Elizabeth Azcona-Hartmark, piano.Progressive Repertoire for Double Bass will introduce American teachers and students to the most important techniques developed for the instrument.</p><p>"So, you have an excellent bass player who needs some extra challenges. But, the rest of your orchestra can't handle the bass literature that offers that challenge. The <i>Progressive Repertoire</i> is an excellent resource of graded solos that one could compare to the Suzuki series for violin, viola, and cello. The benefit of these is that they were arranged by an excellent bass pedagogue using his fingering method that introduces the higher positions first, which I've been told helps the beginning bass player's comfort level since the arm and shoulder are at a more normal level for starters. The pieces are based on octaves, fifths and fourths in the first book, which is an excellent foundation for aural training. Each book comes with a CD of Francois Rabbath performing the pieces, which is helpful as well." --Nebraska Music Educator, April 2010</p><h2>Change! : 71 Glimpses of the Future</h2><p>Short essays describe a wide variety of mind-stretching innovations that will probably occur in our lifetimes, from space colonization to cloned spare parts for our bodies</p><p></p><h2>The Sound Of Kwanzaa</h2><p>Hear the words, sing the songs, dance to the beat, and shout "Harambee!" as you jump into this joyful celebration of the sounds of Kwanzaa!<br><br>The sound is Umoja--bringing us together.<br>The sound is Kuumba--the songs of our ancestors.<br>The sound is Kwanzaa!<br><br>Lively verse and colorful illustrations guide you through the seven principles of this festive holiday.

Ms. Cohen resides and paints in New Orleans.<br>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;While this book serves as an easy introduction to the holiday, it fails to convey a celebratory tone. The Swahili words that comprise the seven guiding principles of Kwanzaa are defined on each spread, but the pronunciation guide appears in an author's note at the back. The boldly colored illustrations showing various people and activities don't always match the text. For example, &amp;Beating drums and singing voices,/ we perform for KUUMBA shows a lone figure quietly painting. Likewise, ceremonial candles are mentioned on each page but not shown until the end. In a note, Tokunbo describes a karamu or traditional feast on the last day of Kwanzaa and includes a recipe for No-Cook Brownie Bites made from dates. An uneven offering that falls rather flat.<i>&#x2013;Madeline J.

Reprint.</p><p>To celebrate DAW Books's 30 years of publishing in the sf and fantasy genres, Wollheim and Gilbert have assembled these volumes that feature authors who have published under the DAW banner and whose works have made significant contributions to the field of imaginative literature. An essay by the editors (repeated in both volumes) relates the history of DAW and its founders, Donald and Elsie Wollheim, while individual author or editor commentaries introduce many of the stories. The fantasy collection includes a variety of stories, including Mercedes Lackey's expression of an author's worst nightmare ("After Midnight") and Christopher Stasheff's melancholy parable of a wizard's journey of bitter self-discovery ("Coronach of the Bell"). Contributions by other notable fantasy writers such as Tanith Lee, Melanie Rawn, and Lynn Abbey round out this collection of 18 tales. The sf anthology collects a stellar group of stories, including Brian Aldiss's cautionary tale of a space-faring warship whose passage results in the death of civilizations ("Aboard the Beatitude") and Tad Williams's wry recounting of the chat room at the end of the world ("Not with a Whimper, Either"). Stories by authors including Frederik Pohl, Timothy Zahn, and Kate Elliott are also among the 19 selections in this well-balanced volume.

Wiseman takes the reader through it all, the industry and the legal battles, and every major recording date, concert, TV special, and film, finally showing Diamond at the top of his form, frustrated by his limited musical craftsmanship yet speaking directly to a wide-ranging audience. He draws on over 100 interviews, giving a balanced picture of the person behind the mystique.

The book is full of vivid insight into what happens to our bodies in the end.

The outdoors is still a source of wonder and excitement for Deirdre &#x2014; the place she goes to "see the possibilities" as well as to ski, hike, and bike with her family.

He rouses an imaginary snow friend, a castle, and even a dragon that takes flight across the wintery pages. The brief text has a pleasant simplicity that rambles with a tempered pace while focusing attention on the more weighty and inspiring pictures. Often occurring within sentences, the page turns feel a bit choppy but don't distract too much from the imaginative narrative, inscribed with a touch of poetry. Although there is also something slightly disjointed about the story&#x2014;in particular, a scene where the snow friend is left behind while the protagonist takes off with the dragon, this book is a solid purchase. The oil-paint illustrations have a likable levity, such as in the boy's slack expression of boredom as he steps backward into the snow, his brother having refused to come out and play. Gill's use of color highlights the boy's red coat, the soft greens of the house, and the golden orange of the dragon, and maintains a lively air despite the soft browns and icy blue shades mixed into the austere landscape. Complete with a nod or two to Ezra Jack Keats's classic The Snowy Day, Outside is a fun opportunity to take a leap of the imagination into softly rendered wintery pages and settle into the wonderland of the outside world.&#x2014;Erin Reilly-Sanders, Ohio State University, Columbus</p><h2>Crimes of the Heart (Plays, Penguin)</h2><p>On Lenny&#39;s birthday, her youngest sister Babe is arrested for shooting her husband, while their middle sister, Meg, a singer, returns to their home in North Carolina from Los Angeles</p><p>This Pulitzer Prize-winner is a deeply touching and funny play about three eccentric sisters from a small Southern town rocked by scandal when Babe, the youngest, shoots her husband.

Growing up in suburban New Jersey, he was the typical American honor student: straight-As, on the lacrosse team, president of the Model U.N. He dreamed of following in his grandfather's footsteps and graduating from the Ivy League. When he arrived at Dartmouth, however, he found not the prestigious college of years past, but a wasteland of privilege and moral entropy. And when he rushed Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity that inspired the rival house in Animal House, Lohse's once-perfect life, as well as his goals, began to crumble around him.</p><p>Lured by free booze and friendly brothers, Andrew pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and soon his life became a dangerous cycle of binge drinking and public humiliation. From chugging vinegar to swimming in a pool of human waste, Lohse's pledge class endured cruelty and psychological coercion in the hopes of obtaining a bid. Although Andrew succeeded in joining the fraternity, the pattern of abuse continued&#x2015;except over time, <i>he</i> became the abuser.</p><p>Told by a contemporary Holden Caulfield, this is a shocking expos� of America's most exclusive institutions and a cautionary tale for modern times.</p></p><p><p>ANDREW LOHSE grew up in Branchburg, NJ. He attended Dartmouth College, where he majored in English. At Dartmouth he was the Rush Chairman of notorious fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the Deputy Editor of The Dartmouth Independent, a columnist for The Dartmouth, and a contributor for both The Dartmouth Review and the Dartmouth Free Press; he also published columns in the New York Daily News and The Harvard Crimson, and was a 2011 poetry fellow at the Vermont Studio Center. Some of his articles&#x2015;including a profile of 2008 Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr, a series of op-eds on Dartmouth's Wall Street recruiting culture, and an expose of his fraternity's hazing practices&#x2015;connected with a wide internet readership and were considered controversial. He was profiled by Rolling Stone in 2012. Also a freelance musician, Lohse lives in Vermont.</p><p>1</p> <p>BOOT ON HIS HEAD</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Vomit is dripping through my hair. It&#x2019;s warm. Gelatinous. Thick. Somehow this feeling is comforting. Maybe that&#x2019;s because I associate it with other feelings. Acceptance. Validation.</p> <p>Now the vomit has reached my neck. Squinting down into the trash can I&#x2019;m bent over&#x2014;staring into the shadow my head casts from the basement&#x2019;s bright fluorescent lights&#x2014;I wonder if this is what amniotic fluid felt like in the womb. I try to remember but can&#x2019;t. After all, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, because back then I wasn&#x2019;t even a real person. Kind of like how not long ago I was a whaleshit, a pledge, a nothing. And now I&#x2019;m a brother.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m even a rush chairman. There&#x2019;s a picture of me on one of the frat&#x2019;s composites: ANDREW B. LOHSE, EMINENT RUSH CHAIRMAN. I think it&#x2019;s on the one hanging over the fireplace in the living room, although it could be on the one hanging over the fireplace in the pool room&#x2014;or maybe it&#x2019;s on the one across from the liquor cabinet, I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;people move them around a lot, mostly to snort coke from them, so I&#x2019;m not sure of the composite&#x2019;s exact location. But in the picture I&#x2019;m smirking, red cheeks over a pink shirt with a white, starched collar. I&#x2019;m wearing a three-piece suit. A tie splattered with Ralph Lauren logos. A pocket square the color of money.</p> <p>Maybe I&#x2019;ve taken this all too seriously. Something about our rituals changed me, deeply, and vomit doesn&#x2019;t bother me, or, maybe, it&#x2019;s proof that I survived my hazing. I know that I definitely wasn&#x2019;t always like this; this is something new. I am a Dartmouth man now. This is normal.</p> <p>The brothers are still chanting, <i>&#x201c;Boot on his head, boot on his head,&#x201d;</i> even though it seems that Randall, one of my older bros, has fully emptied the contents of his stomach onto my skull&#x2014;my skull, whose contents seem to be inert, swimming uselessly around in their own fluids. I&#x2019;m pretty wasted. The chanting dissipates. I lift my head up over the lip of the trash can and scan the brothers arrayed in front of me, an army of preppy statuary, a collection of baby-faced kids from well-off families. Baring perfectly white teeth, they all smile. Again I feel a sense of belonging. We practice secret sacraments that have become expressions of male love, and we will be friends forever.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>When I stand up straight, the puke finds the express lane down the center of my back. Suddenly, it has reached my belt, my belt that is embroidered with a repeating whale motif, the belt I got to help myself fit the frat&#x2019;s look, and I blink, and through heavy-lidded eyes curtained by the typical Wednesday-night binging, I am forced to reassess what is happening.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s possible that this second review is initiated by the boot&#x2019;s interminable slide into my boxer shorts, the ones my mother gave me for Christmas; getting someone else&#x2019;s vomit in your underwear is the kind of buzz-killing sensation that without fail begs you to reassess your animal behavior, and in this brief moment of illumination the jaw-dropping toxicity of our brotherhood is spread bare, at least for me, and I can&#x2019;t help but wonder how my life became like this. Was it the hazing? Was this just another Ivy League tradition? Why has my emotional responsiveness become a phantom limb?</p> <p>By the time I reach for my polo shirt&#x2014;Pulaski, my roommate, is holding it out to me, but between my poor balance and blurry eyes he appears far away, a cartoon on some distant horizon&#x2014;my moment of doubt has passed and I promise myself to continue evading all morality questions. Until I can&#x2019;t anymore. Hopefully, I&#x2019;ll graduate before these questions run me down, though somehow I know I won&#x2019;t get away unscathed. Eventually I&#x2019;ll be forced to make a decision. Just not tonight.</p> <p>Pulaski helps me up onto the benches that line the basement walls like coliseum seats. Two other guys take the spotlight, sidling up over the trash can where Randall and I&#x2019;d just domed, this drinking game&#x2014;I&#x2019;d lost. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d booted on my head. Now everyone is singing in unison. Price hands me a cigarette. Confused, I try to light the wrong end.</p> <p>One of the brothers boots first, missing the can. He has lost the dome. His vomit is the color of rotten chicken cutlets and orange sorbet. It pools on the concrete floor. As an English major I wonder if this is a poetic image I should catalog for the future if I ever try to write about my frat, or about how my life got derailed. Transfixed, I stare at the vomit. I hope someone will mop it up. I&#x2019;m definitely not going to. After all, girls are coming over soon, the sisters of Alpha Phi, and they probably want to party.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>This is just meetings. Normal Wednesday. The anchor of our week. Half an hour ago I was doing homework in the library, studying literature; a year ago I was a wide-eyed freshman with romantic expectations about the Ivy League; months before that I was just a normal high school kid with a pretty girlfriend and a garage band; eighteen years before that I was just a couple of cells floating around in my mom&#x2019;s uterus, basically just a little fingernail. Not even a fucking real person.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Someone told me once that the best way to show what you have is to waste it. It was probably one of my older frat brothers who told me this&#x2014;Ripley or Edwards, two people who always seemed to have a lot of fun wasting things of value. In our case, despite the fucked-up things we do and let be done to us, we don&#x2019;t even believe that we&#x2019;re wasting anything. Because this is just a part of our education. A big part. This, we&#x2019;re told, is a crucial experience that will help us get ahead. If you show you&#x2019;re a team player, valuable connections can be made; someday you might even end up like our frat&#x2019;s most famous alum, this guy the brothers supposedly nicknamed the Ghost back in the good old days. The guy, some argue, who saved the whole Western world. The guy whose signature is on the bills we roll up to snort coke.</p> <p>But I doubt anyone calls him the Ghost anymore. They probably call him his real name, Hank, or maybe some people still call him Secretary Paulson. I wonder what he went through to become a brother. I wonder if he had any doubts, and, if he did, which mental garbage chute he forced them down. Maybe, though, he never had doubts. Maybe he came out the other side totally normal, then went on to a totally normal investment-banking career, then was appointed to be a totally normal Treasury Secretary who did totally normal things with a totally functional conscience. It&#x2019;s hard to tell how much this shit can change you, right?</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Pretty soon I&#x2019;m not thinking about any of this anymore. Meetings end. I clean myself up with some low-grade paper towels. The Alpha Phis come. I have a crush on one, a dancer, a girl with a nose ring and a cryptic smile. We play pong, but I don&#x2019;t linger long at the table because Price tells me he has some blow, so we go upstairs and bolt the bathroom door and cut up lines on the counter and snort them; I guess I&#x2019;m always disappearing from the people I&#x2019;m into and I never give myself a chance. Price and I give each other the secret handshake. For the rest of the night we are invincible.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Andrew Lohse</p></p><h2>Gathered Visions: Selected Works by African American Women Artists</h2><p>Presents works in sculpture, painting, and other media by fifteen artists, and provides information about their careers</p><p></p><h2>With Steinbeck in the Sea of Cortez: A Memoir of the Steinbeck/Ricketts Expedition</h2><p>In 1940, John Steinbeck, newly famous from the publication of Grapes of Wrath, spent the spring collecting marine specimens with Edward Ricketts and five others aboard a 76 foot purse seiner called the Western Flyer.

At the end of the war, he forged a career as a jazz musician, sketch-show writer and performer, before joining forces with Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe to form the legendary Goon Show. Until his death in 2002, he had success as on stage and screen and as the author of over eighty books of fiction, memoir, poetry, plays, cartoons and children&#39;s stories.</p><p>The legendary and iconic figure, Spike Milligan was born at Ahmednagar in India in 1918. He received his first education in a tent in the Hyderabad Sindh desert and graduated from there, through a series of Roman Catholic schools in India and England, to the Lewisham Polytechnic. He then plunged into the world of Show Business, seduced by his first stage appearance, at the age of eight, in the nativity play of his Poona convent school. He began his career as a band musician, but became famous as a humorous scriptwriter and actor in both films and broadcasting.

She began painting in 1991, after being a teacher of literature all of her working life. Within 18 months she was exhibiting landscapes in local juried shows. Initially self-taught, she began studying art history, painting, color theory, drawing and design, and became known as an abstractionist, and later developed her text-and-image collages. As a full-time artist, she continues to break rules and experiment, currently with encaustic.<p><b>Drawing Media</b></p><p>Pens, pencils, pastels, and oil crayons are all useful in mixed-media painting. Bear in mind that acrylic is a wet medium, so your drawing media will need to be waterproof unless applied as a final touch. Even then, they won&#x2019;t work if you plan to add a coat of protective medium or varnish to the piece.</p><p>There are many so-called waterproof pens on the market, but test them first on a separate sheet of paper. Brush a little water over the ink, after you have allowed it to dry. You&#x2019;ll soon see if it &#x201c;bleeds.&#x201d; I have found Sharpie pens to be the most reliable and they come in a variety of tip sizes. For a more creative approach, try using acrylic ink (FW inks come in many different colors) with a calligraphic nib pen.</p><p>Graphite pencils are not entirely waterproof, but if a layer of soft gel medium is brushed over gently, the marks will be prevented from dissolving into a gray mess when the next layer is applied.</p><p>Cheap oil pastels contain very little oil and plenty of filler, making them very suitable for layered work. Unlike true oil sticks, they will not entirely resist acrylics, so they can be easily covered up. They also write well on even the most plastic acrylic paint. The dry particles in charcoal and soft pastels make them vulnerable to lifting by wet media, so it&#x2019;s best to avoid using them.</p><p>The ingredients of crayons and colored pencils vary widely. Those with hard leads will not deposit color on a polymer medium or paint surface. The softer and creamier the pencil, the more likely they are to work. Of course, you can always use colored pencils to decorate your pieces of paper collage before they are stuck down. Black-and-white images colored in with colored pencils can be fun. Be absolutely sure that you are not using water-soluble crayons or pencils&#x2014;usually labeled &#x201c;watercolor&#x201d;&#x2014;or the marks will turn to wet paint when subsequent layers of paint are added. Caran d&#x2019;Ache makes stick wax-oil crayons called Neocolor I, which work extremely well on top of acrylics, even when there is texture underneath. Though more expensive than most drawing crayons, they are waterproof, lightfast, and come in a variety of colors.</p></p><h2>Violation: Collected Essays</h2><p><b>Most Anticipated, Too: The Great 2016 Nonfiction Book Preview<br>The Millions</b><br><br><b>GROUNDBREAKING.

From 1935 she and her second husband, Heinz Neumann, were political refugees in Moscow. In April 1937 Neumann was arrested by the secret police, and executed by the end of the year. She herself was arrested in 1938. Here Buber-Neumann describes the two years of suffering she endured in the Soviet prisons and in the huge Central-Asian concentration and slave labor camp of Karaganda; her extradition to the Gestapo in 1940 at the time of the Stalin-Hitler Friendship Pact; and her five years of suffering in the Nazi concentration and death camp for women, Ravensbr�ck. Her story displays extraordinary powers of observation and of memory as she describes her own fate, as well as those of hundreds of fellow prisoners. She explores the behavior of the guards, supervisors, police, and secret police and compares and contrasts Stalin and Hitler&#x2019;s methods of dictatorship and terror. First published in Swedish, German, and English and subsequently translated and published in a further nine languages, this harrowing in its depiction of life under the rule of two of the most brutal regimes the western world has ever seen is also an inspiring story of survival, of ideology, and of strength, and a clarion call for the protection of democracy.<br><br>Sales Points<br><br>- A highly important testimony of a harrowing wartime experience and a hugely important social document - the only account we have of life in both Soviet and Nazi concentration camps.- Bears comparison to <i>Those Who Trespass Against Us</i>, another Pimlico Original about a Polish Countess's experience in Ravensbruck which sold well and received terrific reviews- Will contain 80 new pages of never before published material pertaining to the book translated by the author's daughter- With an introduction by Nikolaus Wachsmann</p><p>Margarete Buber-Neumann was born in 1901 in Potsdam, Germany. She married Rafael Buber the son of Martin Buber and had two daughters with him. After their divorce, she joined the Communist Party, married Heinz Neumann and was sent to a Soviet labour camp and later, to Ravensbr�ck. After the war, she was invited to Sweden for recuperation where she took an office job and wrote, in the evenings, <i>Als Gefangene bei Stalin und Hitler</i> (<i>Under Two Dictators</i>). In 1949 and 1950 she was a key witness in the Krawtschenko and Rousset trials in Paris, disproving the Communist denial of the existence of the Gulag. She spent the rest of her life in Frankfurt, writing and lecturing widely. The author of eight books, she died in Frankfurt in November, 1989.<br><br>Nikolaus Wachsmann is Senior Lecturer in modern European history at Birkbeck (University of London), where he is directing a major research project on the Nazi camps.

But if you're at all like the people I see in our workshops, then I'm afraid you understand the phrase all too well.</p><p>How did it come to this?</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>Where am I going?</p><p>What do I want?</p><p>Is my life working on any meaningful level? Why doesn't it work better?</p><p>Am I right now dying, slowly, for something I'm not willing to die for?</p><p>WHY AM I WORKING SO HARD, MOVING SO FAST, FEELING SO LOUSY?</p><p>One man I heard about was quite literally going through slow death. A senior executive at a big firm, he was home the last few weeks of his life, in the final stage of cancer, in and out of lucidity, medicated so heavily that his tongue loosened and he regularly spewed his unfiltered, apparently truest thoughts. He cursed at his wife as never before, using vile, demeaning language -- all while she was caring for him day and night, knowing these were his last days on earth, the final days of their long marriage. He did the same to his kids when they visited, making an already difficult situation for them nearly intolerable, and certainly bringing them nothing remotely like peaceful closure. Mostly, though, the man's most shocking, blistering commentary was reserved, in absentia, for his boss: vicious, intermittently coherent paroxysms of resentment and contempt for the president of his firm who, it was painfully obvious now, the dying executive blamed for most of the anger, frustration, and general rottenness he'd felt the past two decades.</p><p>Slow death. It comes in different forms. Two years ago a heart surgeon came to our institute. The first morning he had his blood work done and took a turn in the BodPod (a chamber inside which one's lean body mass can be measured with exceptional accuracy, through the displacement of air rather than water). His results were borderline alarming -- extremely elevated levels of cholesterol, glucose, blood lipids, triglycerides, C-reactive protein. He was given a copy of the results.</p><p>When his turn came to discuss the meaning of the numbers and how to approach them, the surgeon said, "I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>"You know what these numbers mean," said Raquel Malo, our director of nutrition and executive training.</p><p>"Of course I do," he snapped. "I'm a doctor!"</p><p>"What if I was your patient and I got these numbers?"</p><p>"I'd be all over you."</p><p>"Yet you're telling me -- "</p><p>"I said I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>"But -- "</p><p>"Change the subject or I'm on the next plane home," he said. "Don't bring it up again while I'm here."</p><p>Two days later the doctor left, having done nothing to address his perilous health, or even to acknowledge there was anything to address. He returned to his thriving medical practice, where he would continue to caution patients to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease. (Of all the demographics we see, health care providers as a group hover near the bottom in fitness and physical well-being.)</p><p>Slow death: what a harsh phrase. Is that really what's happening to all those people, the ones who start out contented by what is good and pure in life -- a simple cup of coffee, a few seemingly reasonable life goals (a nice salary, say, and one's own home) -- and who, once they've achieved those goals, can't even be satisfied because they've already moved on to life's next-sized latte (six-figure salary, second home, three cars), only to move on to something double-extra grande when that's achieved, a continual supersizing that guarantees one can't ever be fulfilled?</p><p>Okay. Not everyone I see or hear about is dying slowly. But to judge from the responses we get, workshop after workshop, year after year -- and each year it gets worse -- whatever it is they're doing sure doesn't sound fun. It doesn't even sound like getting by. I read the frustration and disappointment in their self-evaluations and hear it in their own voices, if and when they're comfortable enough to read aloud from their current dysfunctional story, the autobiographical narrative they attempt to write the first day at HPI, but usually don't finish until the night before our last day together.</p><p>"Life is hard and getting harder," read one senior VP, with a very big house, a very big salary, and dozens of direct reports. "My current life story is stagnant...On a scale of 1 [worst] to 5 [best], I'd give my health and family each a 2...My biggest feeling about myself is complete disappointment...I have virtually no energy...I'm completely addicted to cell phones and PDAs."</p><p>"The tone of my story is cynical, sarcastic, and ironic," read a forty-three-year-old woman who runs a successful telecom business in the Southwest. "I'm driven to achieve solely for the purpose of being able to point to the accomplishment, and the recognition I receive...I need a more positive view of my future...I do NOT embrace the idea that the story I tell about what happens is more important than what actually happens...My current life story is sad and depressing...My health is a 2, work a 3, happiness and friendship each a 2..."</p><p>"I'm deeply disappointed in myself and always extremely self-critical," wrote a managing director in a financial services firm. "My happiness is a 1; I'm as unhappy as can be. I'm getting divorced after thirty-three years of marriage...My greatest weakness is that I don't trust anyone anymore. The dominant theme in my life is distrust."</p><p>I hardly think it's overstating to call these tragic stories.</p><p>As the workshop progresses and people's defenses start to melt away, we hear more and more of these stories. By almost any reasonable standard, these stories exemplify failure; in many cases, disaster. There is no joy to be found in them, and even precious little forward movement. In every workshop, nearly everyone has a dysfunctional story that is not working in at least one important part of his or her life: stories about how they do not interact often or well with their families; about how unfulfilling the other significant relationships in their lives are; about how -- despite all that extracurricular failure -- they're not even performing particularly well at work (!), or, if they are, about how little pleasure they gain from it; about how they don't feel very good physically and their energy is depleted.</p><p>On top of all that (isn't that enough?), they feel guilty about their predicaments. They know, on some almost buried level, that their life is in crisis and that the crisis will not simply go away. Their company is not going to make it go away. The government is not going to make it go away. God is not going to make it go away.</p><p>And so they wake up one morning to the realization that the bad story they for so long only feared has become finally their life, their story. Not that this development is their fault. No. Nor is there a heck of a lot to be done about it.</p><p>It's a competitive, cutthroat world out there.</p><p>God knows, I want to change but I simply can't. I'll get eaten up and beaten by someone who's willing to sacrifice everything.</p><p>The world moves faster today than it did a generation ago.</p><p>Hey, at least I see my family some weekends. At least we've got a roof over our heads. At least I exercise twice a week.</p><p>What am I supposed to do -- quit my job?</p><p>These are the facts of my life. There's nothing I can do about them.</p><p>My life is a known quantity, so why mess with it even if it's killing me?</p><p>Let me repeat that one:...even if it's killing me.</p><p>As corporate consultant Annette Simmons says in her book, <i>The Story Factor</i>, "People don't need new facts -- they need a new story."</p><p>Recently I conducted a seminar with thirty-two engineers from a profitable company who'd been sent to us not of their own desire -- if it was up to them, it soon enough became obvious, they'd have preferred to undergo a colonoscopy and root canal simultaneously -- but because the head of their division, a recent and enthusiastic attendee of the program, felt it would be useful for them and thus for the company. I could tell that the brainpower in the room, judged on sheer intellectual payload, was staggering. Each engineer had a position of considerable authority, each had several direct reports, each was veteran enough at the company to feel part of the fabric that made it what it was. Early in the session, I asked what might be done to improve their situations at work. Not a single hand went up. When I asked what they thought about their latest job evaluations, the few who spoke expressed the same general idea: They were doing about as well as they expected; there wasn't much that would make things worse or better. It was what it was.</p><p>Over the next half hour, though, I was able to start eliciting some details. Many of them said they couldn't pay much attention to their health because, well, there was obviously no time to exercise before or after work, and to exercise in the middle of the afternoon would feel, as one said, "almost like you're irresponsible."</p><p>"Is there an actual rule against it?" I asked.</p><p>"It's unwritten," he said. "Everyone can feel it."</p><p>So there it was. The corporate culture was at fault. Nothing to be done about it. It was what it was.</p><p>I asked for a new show of hands: How many did get regular exercise? Four engineers out of thirty-two responded.</p><p>"They're single," said one of the others. Everyone laughed.</p><p>"Really?" I said. I turned to the Exercising Four. "How many of you have spouses and children?"</p><p>Three of the four raised their hands.</p><p>"You're married with kids, yet you work out," I said to them. "How is this possible?" I asked the three if they thought that the time they spent exercising was jeopardizing their careers, in the long term, or making it more difficult to get work done, in the short.</p><p>No, said each. "It makes me more productive," said one.</p><p>I then asked the whole group of thirty-two how many had dinner with their family at least three nights a week. Only five did...and -- what do we have here? -- three of the five were the Exercisers Married with Children.</p><p>Some people just figure it out. Why them and not others?</p></p><h2>A Poisonous Plot (Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles)</h2><p><p><b>In his 21st mystery, Batholomew must work fast to decipher the poison used to kill a man&#x2014;as well as the killer himself&#x2014;in a 14th-century college town on the brink of violence</b><br><br> In 1358, over a century after its foundation in Cambridge, the college of Michaelhouse is facing a serious shortfall of funds and competition from upstarts rivals such as Zachary Hostel. Their problems are made no easier by the hostility of the town's inhabitants, who favor the university moving away to the Fens. This simmering tension threatens to break into violence when a well-known tradesman is found dead in one of the colleges. Matthew Bartholomew knows he was poisoned, but cannot identify the actual substance, never mind the killer. He also worries that other illnesses and deaths may have been caused by the effluent from his sister's dye works. Torn between loyalties to his kin and to his college, he fears the truth may destroy both his personal and professional life, but he knows he must use his skills as a physician to discover the truth before many more lose their lives entirely.</p></p><p><p><b>Susanna Gregory</b> is a Cambridge academic&nbsp;and the author of the Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles and the&nbsp;Thomas Chaloner series.</p>Susanna Gregory has an extraordinary ability to conjure up a strong sense of time and place&#x2015;<b>Choice</b><br><br>Susanna Gregory writes with fluency and energy, avoids archaic vocabulary, despite her 14th-century setting and, having had a career as an academic, bases the stories in this enjoyable series on careful research&#x2015;<b>Literary Review</b></p><h2>Return to Grace (A Home Valley Amish Novel)</h2><p>In the shadows of a graveyard, a shot RINGS OUT...&nbsp;<br><br>Hannah Esh fled the Home Valley Amish community with a broken heart, throwing herself into her worldly dreams of a singing career instead.

Besides," Hannah said, "the sign said it's closed after five and you have to make special arrangements with the owners to go in there after dark." She'd been upset when Kevin had driven right up to the entry of the corn maze. Then he and Mike had gotten out to tear a ways into it&#x2014;and come crashing back through one wall of it when they got lost. "And each of us would have to leave a donation," Hannah added as she opened the unlocked, squeaky gate in the wooden fence surrounding the hillside acre of graves and grass.<br><br>"Listen to you!" Tiffany Miles, who worked with Hannah at the recording studio, scolded as she got a blanket out of the trunk. "You can take the Amish girl out of the country, but you can't take the Amish out of the girl. Rules and regs out the wazoo!"<br><br>Kevin Pryor, Tiffany's guy, found that really funny as he and Mike Swanson, Liz's friend, hauled the cooler from the trunk of Kevin's black car. But Hannah wasn't laughing. Ever since her family's barn had burned last spring, she'd been more than homesick. She missed her folks, even her <em>daad,</em> the local bishop she'd had a huge falling-out with. She longed to see others, too, but she couldn't think of that now. Somewhere she'd heard the expression "You can't go home again," and it scared her to death that it might be true.<br><br>Oh, why had she let her friends talk her into this tonight? Worse, Halloween fell on the Sabbath this year, and that bothered her, too. She should have just given them directions but she figured she'd better keep an eye on them. Since she'd recently broken up with her boyfriend, she'd tried to get out of coming along, but they'd insisted they could cheer her up. Yet being back here, all she wanted to do was cry.<br><br>"Perfect place," Mike said with a tip of his velvet top hat, "for a booze and boos party. Boo! We goths have finally gone ghosting!"<br><br>"There are no ghosts here," Hannah insisted, feeling defensive as they passed her grandparents' simple tombstones. "Everyone buried here is at peace." But the truth was she felt haunted by all she'd loved and left behind.<br><br>Mike cranked up the volume on his MP3 player. Deathrock music spewed out, heavy drums and synthesizers to a tribal beat, pulsing but sad, so different from the music Hannah had in her head of singing a country song or a hymn, her own voice blending with Seth's, now as lost to her as all the Amish.<br><br>Suddenly, she wanted to strip off the heavy, draped chain necklaces she wore, the fishnet stockings under the ankle-length, purple ruffled skirt and black velvet jacket. To wash off her heavy eye shadow and black lipstick, to hide her spiky, red-dyed hair under a black bonnet.<br><br>The guys plunked their stuff down pretty much in the middle of the graveyard before she read the name on the closest tombstone. Oh, no! Not Lena Lantz's grave, but it was too late to make them move and no way was she going to explain why. Lena had died almost a year ago, so Hannah had not been here then and had only heard indirectly about the tragedy. It was so hard to believe she'd been away from the Home Valley for nearly three years.<br><br>Kevin passed around wineglasses and poured. Clumps of clouds hid the moon, but he pretended to howl at it. They clinked glasses and drank the bloodred wine.<br><br>"Vampires got nothing on us tonight," Mike teased, and pretended to bite Liz on the neck while she screamed and giggled. Tiffany got to her feet, twirling the parasol she always carried, even after dark&#x2014;what an attention-getter, as if goths needed that. She did a jerky dance around the low, matching stone markers with only the deceased's name, birth and death dates.<br><br>"Stop that. Not funny!" Hannah protested when Tiffany pretended to be digging up Lena's grave with the closed parasol as a shovel. Kevin got up to cavort with her. Suddenly, it was too much. Hannah pictured herself standing nearby with her family and friends when they buried her grandparents...and here lay a young mother, even though she was the woman Seth dumped her for. Hannah hated herself for bringing her friends here where they didn't belong&#x2014;and neither did she.<br><br>She stood and yanked the parasol out of Tiffany's hands and shoved her back from Lena's grave. Then, ashamed that she'd used violence, she turned her back on her friends as tears spilled down her cheeks. Hands on her hips, lifting her gaze up the hill, she stared at the dark woodlot, trying to get control of herself. <em>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills. From whence comes my help?</em> The words ran through her head.<br><br>"Chill out, Hannah!" Kevin protested. "We're just kidding around."<br><br>"Sorry, Tiff," Hannah told her friend, turning back to face them, "but please don't even pretend to do that&#x2014;disturb the dead. We&#x2014;we shouldn't be here."<br><br>Hannah sat back down and took a big swig of their bitter wine&#x2014;another mistake, for she soon felt sick to her stomach and her very soul. She flopped back on the grass, wondering if she was going to throw up, wishing again they were not so near Lena Lantz's grave as her four friends whispered and stared at her.<br><br>Then... Was that sound a clap of thunder? No, there was no storm. A shot?<br><br>The music&#x2014;the voices&#x2014;another sharp sound! Tiffany flew back, fell at Hannah's feet, holding her shoulder, screaming. Everything happened at once. <em>Bang,</em> <em>bang!</em> The gravestone Hannah had been lying near splintered, exploded, peppering her with stone shards. Kevin shouted, "Gun! Someone's got a g&#x2014;" before he threw himself back flat on the ground so he wouldn't be hit. No, he was hit, right in his forehead, where blood bloomed. Tiffany kept screaming as she lay flat on the ground, and Liz and Mike cowered.<br><br>On and on went the beat of the music and a new staccato of shots. Ignoring a sharp pain in her wrist, Hannah belly-crawled for her black macrame bag a few feet away. Cell phone. Get help. Tiffany hurt. Kevin staring at the sky. So dark. Loud blackness.<br><br>She found her phone, punched in 9-1-1, thinking the shooter would come closer, but no more shots. Pulse pounding. In shock? Still alive, still moving, thinking. Terrified but energized. Her own voice frenzied, answering the calm questions on her phone. "Yes, that's what I said. Some people have been shot at&#x2014;shot... Yes, with a gun!... The Oakridge Road Amish graveyard northwest of Homestead. Send help quick!"<br><br>It was only then she saw the left sleeve of her velvet jacket was torn and wet and that her wrist was ripped open and slick with blood.<br><br>Seth Lantz couldn't believe someone was hunting after dark&#x2014;or had a car misfired...more than once?<br><br>It was rolling country here; maybe a car would come roaring over the next hill. No, a woman was screaming. A hunting accident? Maybe <em>Englische</em> kids were playing some sick Halloween prank on the Amish because they ignored this worldly holiday. It was the Sabbath, and he wouldn't even have been hunting today if it didn't help to keep meat on the table. In this far-reaching recession, big building jobs were hard to come by, and he'd been doing pickup repair work lately.<br><br>He reined in his horse as he approached the fenced-in graveyard on Oakridge. His mare, Blaze, tossed her head, upset to be stopped in the middle of nowhere while heading home. That screaming and loud noise: it was from the graveyard.<br><br>He giddyupped Blaze to the gate and saw a black car parked there, though this was an all-Amish <em>graahof.</em> His young wife was buried here, as were his grandparents, including his dear <em>grossdaadi</em> Gideon, who had taught him to build barns. He threw Blaze's reins over a hitching post and, hunched low, went around the outside of the fence instead of through the gate.<br><br>Some sort of loud-beat music thudded on. Amid other voices, the woman's screams had turned to gasping sobs. He put one hand on the wooden fence and vaulted it sideways. No place to really hide in here, no tall monuments, trees or bushes like in English cemeteries, but at least the darkness hid him.<br><br>Then, despite the noise, he picked out a voice he thought he knew, the one that sometimes still danced through his dreams. If it was Hannah Esh, who was she talking to in a one-way conversation?<br><br>"Yes, in the head. He's not moving, not breathing.... Pulse. I&#x2014;I'm not sure.... Two others wounded&#x2014;losing blood, a lot.... Her shoulder and my wrist.... Yes, just visiting.... I&#x2014;yes, I said my name is Hannah Esh, and I used to live near here. I'm dizzy&#x2014;faint.... Yes, thank you, please hurry because Kevin might be dead. ."<br><br>Seth rose to his full height and strode forward, nearly tripping over a prone body. A scarlet cape was splayed out under him, matching the blood that covered his face and white, ruffled shirt. He saw one woman, her arm and chest soaked in blood&#x2014;a woman with dark-lined eyes. A horror movie he'd seen once in his <em>rumspringa</em> days darted through his mind: ghouls robbing graves and feeding on corpses.<br><br>He saw another woman sobbing, bent over on the ground. And then the one he sought, though he hardly recognized her, hadn't seen her for more than three years, had only heard what she'd done to herself after what he'd done to her.<br><br>"Hannah," he choked out, "it's Seth. Are you hurt?"<br><br>Tears streaming black lines down her ravaged face, the woman who had once been the love of his life looked up at him. "Seth? Sorry. I&#x2014;we&#x2014;I called for help. He's dead, I think, and I just want to die from pain and shame."<br><br>She looked like something from the depths of hell, as he bent to rip the purple velvet ruffles off the bottom of her long skirt. Using his pocket knife to cut the material, he made a tourniquet for her arm and wrapped her bleeding wrist. He made a pressure pack for the other girl's shoulder and told the unharmed girl to keep her hand on it, even though it hurt the one who had been shot. He put two fingers to the blood-slick side of the young man's neck, then flipped up the edge of the blanket over the lifeless body.<br><br>Striding back toward the huddled group, he asked the man who had not been shot, "What happened here? Did one of you do this?"<br><br>That man's eyes were wide, his face expressionless. He, too, wore dark-eyed makeup and was dressed fancy, old-fashioned. After a moment, as if it took time for the question to sink in, the man shook his head. "From out there," he said, pointing up the slant of hill toward the back of the graveyard. "From the dark."<br><br>"Turn that music off," Seth said. Looking dazed, the man fumbled with the MP3 player, and silence finally descended. Seth hurried up the hill, ran the entire fence line, seeing no one, though someone could be hiding, watching in the woods higher up. It made the hair on the back of his neck prickle.<br><br>He heard distant sirens and went back to hold the blood-soaked velvet to Hannah's wrist. "Why are you all here? What in the world...?" he started to ask, then bit off the rest when he saw that Hannah lay almost on his wife's grave and that her marker had been blasted to bits.<br><br>Hannah's pain got worse, worse. Cold waves, then sizzling hot in her wrist, hand, arm. Twirling now, floating. Seth could not really be here. Had her thoughts summoned him? Had he come to be with Lena? His handsome face sported a blond beard now. Well, of course it did...married man, even if widowed. And with a child, a girl, Lena's child, must be two years old now, named Marlena. How it had hurt to hear all that, but she'd asked her friend Sarah to keep her informed, anyway.<br><br>What in the world? Seth's words kept revolving through Hannah's head. She had gone to the world, left her people. Seth's fault? Lena's? Her own? Because of the terrible argument she'd had with her father? Forgive Seth? She could not. She'd jumped the fence, left the Plain People, tried to have a singing career, tried to fit in, but really didn't.<br><br>Bright blinking lights, a siren that went silent. People to help, medics. A little beam of light in each eye. Voices, words flying by she tried to grab. Seth's voice, then these strangers' words.<br><br>"...Can't transport him...deceased...bled out. Bullet to the head. Crime scene. Sheriff Freeman should be here soon. He can call the coroner."<br><br>"Wooster, E.R., we're going to transport two females with gunshot wounds, shoulder, wrist...starting IVs...sending vitals."<br><br>"Did you see what happened here, Mr. Lantz?"<br><br>Muffled words in and out of her head.<br><br>Lifted onto a gurney, carried, made the pain worse. IV in her arm, wrist bandaged. Two emergency vehicles, bloodred lights piercing the night, but so bright inside where they lifted her, slid her in. The sound of a buggy, a single horse's hoofbeats coming fast, a voice she knew. <em>Daad!Mamm,</em> too! Was she dreaming?<br><br>"We saw the blinking lights from our house. Did a car hit a buggy? Can we help?" her father asked in English.<br><br>In their German dialect, her mother said, "Seth, Naomi's with Marlena, so don't you worry for that. <em>Ach,</em> what happened here?"<br><br>Before Hannah could hear an answer, with great difficulty, she lifted her head to look out past her feet. If she was going to die, to bleed out or never be allowed back here again, she was going to get a glimpse of her parents.<br><br>"Bishop Esh," Seth was saying, "Hannah was here with worldly friends. She's been hurt&#x2014;shot, and she's inside that one, right there."<br><br>Her mother peered into the E.R. vehicle. It had been so long since Hannah had looked into her pale blue eyes. More wrinkles than Hannah remembered. <em>Mamm</em> looked grieved. Grieved for her.<br><br>"Oh, <em>Mamm,"</em> Hannah got out before bursting into tears.<br><br>Her father, white beard, intense stare, squinted into the brightness at her, and choked out his childhood nickname for her. "Hanni!"<br><br><em>Mamm</em> climbed right up, came in and bent over her, holding her other hand. "I'm going with her," she called out to <em>Daad</em> with Seth standing so tall behind him, though Hannah could barely make out their silhouettes in this brightness. "You tell Naomi to take care of things, Joseph."<br><br>"Naomi," Hannah heard herself repeat her younger sister's name. "How is.Naomi?"<br><br>"Planning her wedding to Joshua Troyer in two weeks," <em>Mamm</em> said, close to her ear. "You can help her with things when you come home and let that painted scarlet hair grow out to your real blond." She stroked Hannah's forehead, brushing her gel-spiked hair back. With her unhurt hand, before she remembered it was tethered by IVs, Hannah seized her mother's wrist and held tight. If she did die, she thought as she began to slip away, she could at least go grateful: she'd seen Seth and he had helped her; <em>Mamm</em> and <em>Daad</em> at least still claimed her; and sweet Naomi was going to be married...going to be married.<br><br>Someone slammed the door and her thoughts went black.<br><br></p><h2>Kotik Letaev (European Classics)</h2><p>One of the most important works of twentieth-century Russian prose, <i>Kotik Letaev,</i> the great symbolist novel of childhood, depicts the emergence of consciousness and its development into self-consciousness in a Russian boy growing up among the Moscow intelligentsia in the 1800s.<br><br>Kotik's experience is based on elements from Bely's own early childhood, but on a larger level his experience represents the stages of human history, the history of philosophy, and childhood language development.

A former president of the American Crime Writers League and current president of the Arkansas Mystery Writers Alliance, she lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p><br> Once again I found myself trudging toward the high school cafeteria for a meeting. The last one had been courtesy of the school board, and mayhem and murder had followed within a matter of weeks. That, I believe, is a pretty damn good reason to ban all meetings, especially in Maggody, Arkansas (population 755 or so, depending on what you count). I don't object to the Missionary Society getting together at the Voice of the Almighty Lord Assembly Hall to grumble about the heathens over coffee and cinnamon rolls, or the Wednesday night potluck suppers where paper plates runneth over with ham, green bean casseroles, and lemon squares. The ladies of the County Extension chapter are welcome to their weekly discussions of the blatantly biased judging of pickled okra at the fair every fall. For that matter, what business is it of mine if Mayor Jim Bob Buchanon huddles with his cronies to play poker in the back room of Roy Stiver's Antiques Shop? </p><p> But this was an official town meeting, and my appearance as chief of police was mandatory -- or so I'd been told by Mrs. Jim Bob only that morning. She'd refused to say what the meeting was about or why I had to be there, but I had a feeling I was neither going to be fired (who else would have my miserable job?) nor presented with a raise (miserable and miserly have a certain similarity). When I'd slunk back to Maggody after a nasty divorce from a Manhattan advertising hotshot who appreciated the finer things in life -- as long as they were blond and mindless -- I hadn't expected much more than a semblance of sympathy and a whole lot of home cookin' from my mother, Ruby Bee, proprietor of a bar &amp; grill of the same name. I'd declined her offer to let me live in one of the units in the Flamingo Motel out back and had instead rented what was supposedly an efficiency apartment above the antiques shop. It was cold and clammy in the winter, and steamy in the summer. The cockroaches thrived in both climates, and I doubted global warming (or an ice age) would deplete their numbers. </p><p> Ruby Bee didn't have a clue about the reason for the meeting, and she knows darn close to every last thing that happens within the city limits, including sneezes, wheezes, and sexual trysts outside the confines of holy matrimony. Her best friend Estelle Oppers owns Estelle's Hair Fantasies out on County 101. What Ruby Bee doesn't hear about in the bar is gleaned there during perms and manicures, when a mere hangnail can lead to sobbing admissions of unrequited love or shoplifting at the supermarket. Growing up in Maggody was always a challenge for someone of a teenaged persuasion who liked to drink a little beer on the banks of Boone Creek and count the lightnin' bugs. </p><p> If you don't know what that means, settle for a literal interpretation. </p><p> I caught up with Ruby Bee and Estelle at the front door of the high school, and we walked down the corridor together. </p><p> "You still don't know what this is about?" I asked them. </p><p> Ruby Bee growled. "No, I don't reckon anyone in town except Mrs. Jim Bob knows. Lottie Estes said all the teachers were ordered to attend. None of them's happy about it." </p><p> "But this ain't a school board meeting," Estelle pointed out, waggling her red beehive of hair for emphasis. She and Ruby Bee make a very odd couple, since one resembles a fire hydrant atop a fencepost and the other a short stack of unbaked biscuits. </p><p> We continued into the cafeteria and sat down at a lunch table in the back of the room. Quite a few folks were already wiggling uncomfortably on the plastic benches, muttering among themselves about how some damn fool meeting was interfering with their constitutional right to vegetate in front of the television. Earl and Eileen Buchanon nodded at us, as did Elsie McMay and a visibly disgruntled Lottie Estes. Darla Jean McIlhaney sat with her parents, Millicent and Jeremiah. Larry Joe Lambertino, who's the shop teacher, and his wife, Joyce, were hissing at each other, which they did a lot. </p><p> At a table in the front of the room sat Hizzoner the Moron (aka Jim Bob Buchanon), his wife Mrs. Jim Bob (aka Barbara Ann Buchanon Buchanon), Roy Stiver, and a stout woman with steely gray hair and the expressiveness of a bass beached on a gravel bar in the midday sun. </p><p> Ruby Bee nudged me. "Who in tarnation do you think that is?" </p><p> "How would I know?" I said, still scanning the room to see who all had been bullied into attending the meeting. A fair percentage of them were Buchanons, but that was not remarkable, since there are more Buchanons in Stump County than flies on a dead possum. Most of them have protuberant foreheads, thick lips, and yellowish eyes, and there's nary a college grad among them, mostly due to the dropout rate long about eighth grade. Nevertheless, a few of them are as wily as pole cats. Raz Buchanon's been running his still up on Cotter's Ridge since the dawn of time. When I'm truly bored, I pack a picnic lunch and go looking for it, but the sumbitch stays a step ahead of me. The Arkansas two-step, I suppose. </p><p> Jim Bob banged his fist on the tabletop. "Okay, I'm calling this meeting to order. We're gonna skip the minutes from the last meeting and the treasurer's report and all that crap. Mrs. Jim Bob has the floor, so y'all listen up." </p><p> Even though Mrs. Jim Bob has plenty of Buchanon blood, her lips are thinner than paper matches and her eyes are dark and beady. She has never risked eternal damnation by painting her face like a common floozy, and her hair was reminiscent of a style predominant in 1960s high school yearbooks. As usual, she was wearing a starchy white blouse buttoned to the top despite the lack of air-conditioning. </p><p> She stood up and waited as her audience settled down for what well might be an interminable session. "Thank you for coming," she said with a brief smile. "A most exciting thing is about to happen right here in Maggody, and it's going to require full cooperation from all our Christian, law-abiding citizens. I am pleased that so many of you put aside your self-indulgent and slothful ways to attend this evening." </p><p> "Good thing Raz ain't here," whispered Ruby Bee. </p><p> Mrs. Jim Bob frowned at her, then continued. "Now I'd like to introduce Miss Harriet Hathaway, who lives over in Farberville and is the president of the Stump County Historical Society. Let's give her our full attention." </p><p> She began to clap, so the rest of us dutifully followed suit. Once the pitter-patter faded, the woman stood up and said, "As you were told, I am Harriet Hathaway, and I've been the president of the Stump County Historical Society for fifteen years. The society manages the Headquarters House, which was controlled by both Confederate and Union forces during the Civil War. We also publish a quarterly digest called <i>Remembrances of Stump County's Past,</i> provide programs for schoolchildren, and sponsor an ice cream social in the summer. I'd planned to bring slides, but I was informed that a projector and screen could not be made available." </p><p> "Hallelujah," mumbled someone off to the side of the room. </p><p> "Excuse me?" said Mrs. Jim Bob, rising to her feet. "Do you wish to contribute to the discussion, Earl Buchanon?" </p><p> "No, ma'am, it's just that there's a baseball game what's already started, and I was hopin' we'd be done right soon so I can -- " </p><p> "Then you'd best stop interrupting. Now, Miss Hathaway, if you'll tell us your exciting news..." </p><p> Miss Hathaway appeared a little flustered, probably because the historical society meetings were exercises in tea and cookies. In Maggody, we're more into RC Colas and Moon Pies. </p><p> "Well, then," she said, "as I'm sure many of you know, this year will be the one hundred and fortieth anniversary of the Battle of Farberville, fought primarily on the hillside above the Headquarters House. Over three hundred Confederate troops died or were wounded before the Union forces prevailed." </p><p> "Damn Yankees," said Jim Bob, then ducked his head as his wife stared at him. </p><p> "So what's this got to do with Maggody?" asked Estelle. </p><p> "Three days before the battle, a small unit from the Arkansas Fifth, garrisoned in Little Rock at that time, arrived at the edge of Stump County after an arduous six-day trek. They were bringing two saddlebags of gold to pay the soldiers of General Lambdin's brigade, which was coming from the west to halt a Union attempt to secure the Arkansas-Missouri border. They rode mules because they were pulling a cannon on a caisson and a wagon filled with munitions. Their numbers had been depleted due to swollen creeks and the muddy conditions of the road. Also, according to a journal entry made by a young private named Henry Largesse, they'd gorged themselves on green persimmons and many of them had to remain behind as the rest moved north." She paused for effect, but no one seemed overwhelmingly entranced by the narrative. "When they arrived not too far from here, the lieutenant decided to camp near what is now called Boone Creek and allow the men a full day and night of rest before what would surely be a bloody battle." </p><p> Ruby Bee flapped her hand. "So this is what we're all supposed to be so excited about? They came, they camped, and then went and got theirselves shot?" </p><p> "If you will please allow me to continue," said Miss Hathaway, her voice as steely as her hair, "I'll be succinct. It seems the soldiers found a small, squalid farm and took a pig back to camp to be roasted. Despite the fact this was an unfortunately common practice on both sides, the rightful owner was so incensed that he threatened them with a shotgun and was severely thrashed for his lack of patriotism. He was quite lucky not to have been hanged. In retaliation, he rode to the Missouri border and informed a Union general named Alessio of the proximity of the Confederate unit, although most likely not in those exact terms. General Alessio immediately dispatched a cavalry troop to ambush the unit from Little Rock and take possession of the cannon, wagon, and mules. It is unlikely that he was aware of the gold in the saddlebags." </p><p> Estelle elbowed me and whispered, "This is gettin' kind of interesting, ain't it? One side's got gold and a cannon, and the other side is aiming to bushwhack 'em. I wonder why we never heard any of this before." </p><p> "Could be because no one's written a comprehensive history of this meadow muffin of a town," I whispered back. "Remember when that genealogist tried to chart the Buchanon family tree? Supposedly she had an accident after driving away, but I've always suspected suicide." </p><p> "Chief of Police Hanks," chirped Mrs. Jim Bob, "please save your discourteous behavior for a more appropriate moment. My apologies, Miss Hathaway." </p><p> Miss Hathaway nodded at her. "Yes, of course. During the night, while the Confederates were sleeping off their fine feast, the Union soldiers took a position in a field near the road and waited for sunrise." She picked up a notebook and flipped it open. "I will now read the pertinent entry from the private's journal, written several weeks after the incident. The journal itself only came to light a few weeks ago, when a family member found it in a trunk and donated it to the historical society. Here is an excerpt: 'Come dawn we got the gear stowed and the mules saddled, then headed out. The lieutenant, scared as the rest of us, said we'd most likely meet up with General Lambdin's troops by nightfall. My second cousin from down by Booneville was one of their gunners, so I was looking forward to seeing him and swapping family news. I found out later he'd died of dysentery only a month earlier, likely without never hearing about his sister's baby.'" Miss Hathaway looked up. "He now digresses about family affairs, and then continues. 'We'd gone mebbe not a quarter of a mile when out of nowhere comes musket fire from a field off to the east. We hunkered behind a low stone wall and tried to figure out where the Yanks was. Custiss volunteered to scout 'em out, but was shot square in the back afore he could take three steps. Some of the boys was shaking so hard I thought they'd pass out, but somehow we all grabbed our muskets and returned fire. This goes on for most of the morning. We could see the bastards, but we was already outnumbered and couldn't seem to force them back. By noon, we were down to six boys and the lieutenant, who was getting mighty grim. He ordered Emil Jenks to take the gold up on the ridge behind us and hide it in a cave so it wouldn't fall into Yankee hands if we dint make it. Soon as Emil got back, all covered with mud and panting like a coon dog, the lieutenant took a hit to the side of his head and took to bleeding like a stuck pig. He ordered us to git ourselves on the mules and get the hell out afore we was all slaughtered, saying we should come back for the gold later. Emil was trying to tell us where he'd hid the saddlebags when a mini� ball took him in the throat. I don't reckon I can ever forget the look on his face when he fell. The rest of us lit out like Satan was snapping at our heels and didn't ease up till we was a good mile away.'" </p><p> Miss Hathaway stopped reading and said, "The entry goes on to describe how the young private was shot in the thigh during the Battle of Farberville and had his leg amputated by a field surgeon. He managed to survive long enough to make it to his home, where he eventually died of complications from the surgery." </p><p> "So what about the gold?" asked Earl Buchanon, who'd clearly forgotten all about home runs and double plays. "Is it still up there?" </p><p> Miss Hathaway shrugged. "According to the journal, the private was the only one of the Confederates involved in the Skirmish at Cotter's Ridge to survive the Battle of Farberville, and he was in no condition to be sent back to find the precise location. All he could tell General Lambdin was that there were a few dirt-scratch farms, a creek, and a ridge. That description could fit many of the communities in Stump County, even today." </p><p> "We got us a stoplight and a fine supermarket," said Jim Bob. </p><p> "I'm sure you do," she said, not turning to look at him. "In order to commemorate the Battle of Farberville, the historical society has received a grant for various projects. We can hardly stage a reenactment of the battle itself, since the hill where it took place is now cluttered with homes and power lines. Therefore, we have decided to make a documentary film of what took place here. With meticulous camera angles and editing, we feel as though we can end up with a reasonably accurate depiction. It will be shown at the Headquarters House as an important part of our educational program." </p><p> "Remember when those Hollywood folks tried to make a movie here?" whispered Estelle. "Now that was something." </p><p> Ruby Bee leaned around me. "These ain't Hollywood folks, Estelle." </p><p> "I doubt this documentary will have any sex scenes," I said drily. </p><p> Eileen Buchanon stood up. "So what does this mean to us?

So great was the Soviet success with the P-39, some forget that the aircraft also served well for the British, Free French, and US. Created in response to the US Army Air Corps Circular Proposal X-609, issued in February 1937, Bell Aircraft&#39;s P-39 boasted an innovative layout. The engine was positioned behind the pilot with a long shaft connecting it to the propeller. Lack of a turbo-supercharger and limited room for on-board fuel tanks made the aircraft ill-suited to high-altitude combat, and as a result many of the P-39s were shipped to the Soviet Union, where relatively low speeds and low altitudes were characteristic of air combat. Soviet pilots appreciated the P-39&#39;s armament, particularly its 37mm nose cannon. Despite its high-altitude limitations, US combat forces made good use of the P-39 in the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters, where in lower-altitude engagements, the aircraft held its own against Zeros and other enemy planes.</p><p></p><h2>The Tragedy of Political Science: Politics, Scholarship, and Democracy</h2><p>A comprehensive review and thoughtful critique of the development of political science as an academic discipline in this century, Ricci&#x2019;s strong indictment of political science will be a source of lively controversy and discussion for years to come.&nbsp;&#x201c;A provocative, rich and rewarding book that advances a thesis that will be hotly and widely debated by political scientists...Intelligent, lucid, scholarly, [and] well-argued.&#x201d;&#x2014;Neal Riemer, <i>American Political Science Review</i><br>&#x201c;A first class critical examination of political science in American since its beginnings...a century ago. &nbsp;It warrants thoughtful reading by both novices and established professors...A learned, incisive, and balanced work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dwight Waldo, <i>Political Science Quarterly</i><br>&#x201c;An informative and truly provocative work.<i> &nbsp;The Tragedy of Political Science </i>is both a scholarly study of American political science as an academic discipline and a practical moral argument on behalf of its fundamental reordering...Ricci&#x2019;s book is an extremely interesting work. &nbsp;Its clarity of style and attention to scholarly detail make it an unusually accessible work...Any member of the discipline would benefit from the overview which Ricci constructs. &nbsp;His summaries of the various schools and traditions within American political science are truly impressive.&#x201d;&#x2014;James L.

View her insightful and passionate analysis along with a condensed reading and student comments on the course. <p></p><p> Poet and critic are well met, as one of our best writers on poetry takes up one of the world's great poets. </p><p> Where other books on the Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney have dwelt chiefly on the biographical, geographical, and political aspects of his writing, this book looks squarely and deeply at Heaney's poetry as art. A reading of the poet's development over the past thirty years, <i>Seamus Heaney</i> tells a story of poetic inventiveness, of ongoing experimentation in form and expression. It is an inspired and nuanced portrait of an Irish poet of public as well as private life, whose work has given voice to his troubled times. </p><p> With characteristic discernment and eloquence, Helen Vendler traces Heaney's invention as it evolves from his beginnings in <i>Death of a Naturalist </i>(1966) through his most recent volume, <i>The Spirit Level </i>(1996). In sections entitled "Second Thoughts," she considers an often neglected but crucial part of Heaney's evolving talent: self-revision. Here we see how later poems return to the themes or genres of the earlier volumes, and reconceive them in light of the poet's later attitudes or techniques. Vendler surveys all of Heaney's efforts in the classical forms--genre scene, elegy, sonnet, parable, confessional poem, poem of perception--and brings to light his aesthetic and moral attitudes. </p><p> Seamus Heaney's development as a poet is inextricably connected to the violent struggle that has racked Northern Ireland. Vendler shows how, from one volume to the next, Heaney has maintained vigilant attention toward finding a language for his time--"symbols adequate for our predicament," as he has said. The worldwide response to those discovered symbols suggests that their relevance extends far beyond this moment.</p></p><p><b>Helen Vendler</b> is A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University.Ms. Vendler's <i>Seamus Heaney</i> serves as a wonderfully succinct road map to the poet's verse, illuminating the effect that both private and public events have had on the development of his work, while explicating the continual evolution of his style. She shows us how Mr. Heaney has pushed the boundaries of the traditional lyric poem in his efforts to articulate his changing vision of the world, even as she helps us to understand his masterly use of sound, symbol, imagery and parable. (Michiko Kakutani <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>[Helen Vendler's] reading of Heaney is a marvelously illuminating achievement...Most magically of all, [this book] manages, while rejecting engagement on the 'thematic' level, to be constantly stimulating towards other readings while it entertains. (Bernard O'Donoghue <i>Essays in Criticism</i>)<br><br>Seamus Heaney's readers will welcome this latest study of his work, written by America's most distinguished poetry critic, Helen Vendler...A thoughtful lyric poet with the power to re-think and re-feel his earlier positions, Vendler's Heaney emerges as not only a better craftsman, with profound linguistic resources, but also as a conscientious citizen of letters, and a restless re-maker of himself. (Jonathan Allison <i>South Atlantic Review</i>)<br><br>It is perhaps the subject of Northern Ireland that has primarily been responsible for attracting a large audience to Heaney's work. In her comprehensive and passionate new book, <i>Seamus Heaney</i>, the critic Helen Vendler reminds us, however, that 'thematic elements do not by themselves make for memorable poetry.' Instead, Vendler...deals chiefly with Heaney's craft, including his poetic inventiveness and ongoing experimentation with form and expression...[Vendler] has asserted that while a poet is inextricably connected to certain struggles, it is the ability to find new approaches to language to convey those struggles that determines his or her genius. And Vendler's survey of 11 books of poetry...clearly makes the case that Heaney has sustained such attention to language, often brilliantly bringing to light his thematic , aesthetic and moral concerns...As Vendler shows, symbol-making is only part of Heaney's excellence. She stresses the masterful formal designs that convey these symbols throughout the decades of Heaney's lyrics...One finishes her book with a remarkably clear understanding of Heaney's outstanding adventures in form and expression, and of poetry itself. If it's true, as I believe it is, that only a few poets each century actually change the way we understand the possibilities of our language, then Heaney has earned his place as one of those. Most important, however, one finishes Vendler's critical study more inspired to return to Heaney's masterful, rigorous and deeply moving poems, which are in love with listening, life and the life of language. (Jason Shinder <i>Newsday</i>)<br><br>Vendler comments with the energy of one who has learned great sensitivity for both the work and the workers described in Heaney's poems of dockers, eel-fishers, ploughmen, cattle dealers, threshers and thatchers. Vendler allows the reader to witness her enthusiasm for the poem's craft as well as the crafts contained and celebrated in the stanzas...She eloquently expresses the poet's confrontation with contradictions of political violence, as well as sexuality, death and alienation. Both Seamus Heaney and Helen Vendler, it becomes evident, have lived and written to strengthen in people a refined sense for keen details and for courageous statements. As a critic, Vendler not only has identified the poet's phases of life and moments of creative growth and change, she has demonstrated with zeal how creative and provocative changes have characterized both the personal and the public life of the poet. (John Lavin <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>Vendler is an ideal commentator on Heaney's development. She keep her eye firmly on the wording of the poems, only bringing in evidence from external circumstances when it bears directly on them...What confirms Vendler's book as such an excellent introduction to Heaney is her enlightening analyses of the later poems of the 1990s...By the end, Vendler leaves little reason to dispute Heaney's pre-eminence in all worlds: public, private and familial. Her book is a triumph for the poet and the reader. (Bernard O'Donoghue <i>Toronto National Post</i>)<br><br>Vendler's book is a clear, concise, and comprehensive study of Heaney's poetic <i>oeuvre</i>...Vendler strikes just the right note in her analysis of the relationship between Heaney's evolving poetic style and the Troubles in Northern Ireland...In her attention to Heaney's 'second thoughts'...Vendler makes a powerful argument for his humane political witness, accomplished by being faithful to the aim of lyric poetry, 'to grasp and perpetuate, by symbolic form, the self's volatile and transient here and now'...[An] illuminating orientation. (Daria Donnelly <i>Commonweal</i>)<br><br>The task [Helen Vendler] sets herself in this book is to demonstrate exactly how, by various means and in answer to a range of provocations, artistic, historic, and personal, the remarkable growth and development of Heaney's poetry over the last thirty years has been achieved...It is difficult to imagine a critic more in tune with her subject. Alert to the part played by etymological knowledge and wit in Heaney's work, she is also, thanks to her Irish Catholic upbringing, able to clarify for the uninstructed the meaning of his liturgical references. The political dimensions of Heaney's work, the 'dolorous circumstances' of Ireland, are referred to where necessary with restraint, compassion, and brevity...[Helen Vendler is] our period's most distinguished literary critic. (Ann Cobb <i>Harvard Review</i>)<br><br>In this critical study of Ireland's foremost living poet, Vendler explores the stylistic and thematic elements that have made Heaney a poet of stature and wide popularity. Beginning with his first book, <i>Death of a Naturalist</i> (1966), moving through the developments and considerations of Heaney's several volumes of poetry, and ending with <i>The Spirit Level</i> (1996), Vendler examines the poet's changes in technique, language, and structure...This study...goes far into understanding how the intrusions and struggles of daily life define what a poet will write about and how he will write it. (John Kennedy <i>Antioch Review</i>)<br><br>Great poets demand great critical readers, and in this regard Heaney has been blessed by the steady attention of American's foremost critic of poetry, Helen Vendler. Vendler's lucid, insightful study plots the trajectory of Heaney's poetic development from the 1960's to the present. Focusing on the art of his poems, she examines the internal structures of words, syntax, rhythm, voice and symbol that dramatize the poet's emotional responses to his experience. At the same time, Vendler demonstrates how Heaney has expanded and revised the nature of the personal lyric and cultural pressures of his time...Vendler's study, in my view, is the best analysis of Heaney the poet yet published. She brilliantly unfolds the dynamics of his poetry by her subtle reading of his language, voice and the deft syntactical shifts that give his work its lyric power and range of implication. Vendler demonstrates how Heaney is a poet of 'second thought,' one whose work constantly re-scrutinizes itself in terms of the demands of reality, justice and art...Her superb commentary achieves what first-rate criticism should do: it makes us want to go back and read the poems again.

If this biography of the Danish physicist, whom colleagues referred to as "the pope," isn't as adventurously designed as<i> Fallout</i> (2001), Ottaviani and company's book on J. Robert Oppenheimer, Leo Szilard, and the Manhattan Project, it is just as--maybe more--ambitious. Ottaviani, who writes the text and recruits artist-collaborators, aims to inculcate the basics of quantum physics as he tells Bohr's life story. Leland Purvis, artist for the main text, responds to Ottaviani's intentions by switching, as needed, between realism and fantasy (e.g., huge Bohr and huge Einstein astride different planets while arguing quantum theory). The partnership operates near perfectly, and only the unexplained Greek letters in equations (p we know, but D and l?) give nonmathematicians, at least, pause--but don't impede understanding. In the endnotes Ottaviani and several different artists limn instructive anecdotes about early physics, relay Bohr apocrypha, and create a series of comic strips about taciturn French physicist Paul Dirac--all pretty priceless. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His legendary tenure with the San Francisco 49ers through the 1980s will be remembered as one of the most dominating periods in professional sports. And unlike many of the great quarterbacks, Montana posted both the numbers <i>and</i> the big wins necessary to cement his place in the Hall of Fame. With coauthor Richard Weiner, Montana relates his special knowledge of the game in <i>Joe Montana's Art and Magic of Quarterbacking</i>, a treasury of instruction, anecdotes, and inside-the-huddle information that should earn the cheers of football fans and players everywhere. <p> In addition to instructional chapters on ball-handling, offensive and defensive formations, pass patterns, and conditioning, Montana also covers the more advanced aspects of playing quarterback, such as reading defenses and calling audibles. With examples right out of the 49er playbook, he dissects contemporary offenses and defenses, emphasizing his points with well-known plays and situations from his own storied career, including postseason classics such as "The Catch" and "The Drive." A winning combination of color action shots and chalkboard-style diagrams--plus memorable sidebar quotes from coaches and players--makes <i>Joe Montana's Art and Magic of Quarterbacking</i> an attractive and informative addition to the pigskin bookshelf.

In Mockery of Justice, his son Sam Reese Sheppard and attorney Cynthia L. Cooper reinvestigate the crime. Drawing on recently recovered documents, Sheppard family papers, and interviews with new witnesses and suspects, they offer convincing evidence pointing to the real murderer, evidence that has persuaded the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor to reopen the investigation into the case.</p><p>In 1996, Sam Reese Sheppard spoke on <i>All Things Considered</i>: "My mother and dad were very flamboyant people.... They were out of step ... in the Bible Belt of Ohio at that time, but, very quickly, and it happens today, a high-profile case spins out of control, and hatred and hysteria rise in the community. When a pregnant woman dies in an ugly way in our community, people are stricken with fear ... the blame on my dad got pinpointed by the newspapers." Dr. Sheppard was convicted of the 1954 murder of his wife. In 1966 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he'd been denied a fair trial. He was re-tried, found innocent, then died a few years later. <i>Mockery of Justice</i> goes into all the details: Dr. Sheppard's own account of that night, the role of a powerful coroner, the media frenzy, the mysteries surrounding the case records, and the recent investigation of a likely suspect for the murder. The analysis of forensic riddles posed by the complex crime scene makes for especially intriguing reading. The book includes map, timeline, footnotes, and index.Just as the O.J. Simpson case is the trial of the 1990s, the Sam Sheppard case was the trial of the 1950s and 1960s. Because of pretrial publicity and the police department's sloppy investigation, Dr. Sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife, Marilyn. The police and the media never considered any other suspects in this case. Sheppard proclaimed his innocence and appealed his conviction. F. Lee Bailey, unknown at the time, took over the case when Sheppard's lawyer died and successfully argued for a new trial because of the pretrial publicity and the "rush to judgment" on the case. The Supreme Court decision set the standard for future trials and procedures. Cooper, a lawyer, and Sam Reese Sheppard, the doctor's only child and a death penalty opponent, present their case that Sam Sheppard was innocent and suggest others who were never investigated as possible suspects. Officially, the case on Marilyn Sheppard remains unsolved. The Cuyahoga County prosecutor is currently reviewing the facts in the case to determine whether it should be reopened. Expect demand because of the subject and increased demand should the case be reinvestigated.

Prior to 1966, if artists wanted to create works larger than their studios or metalworking abilities allowed, they had to turn to industrial manufacturers, who were often unable to accommodate the creative process of making art. <em>Large Scale</em> tells the story of Lippincott, Inc., which, from 1966 to 1994, put the tools of industrial fabrication in the hands of artists, allowing them to produce at a scale they had previously only dreamed of on paper. Lippincott worked with artists from the conception of a project to the completed sculpture, displaying pieces in the field adjoining the shop before installing them all over the country and the world. Drawing on the vast collection of images in the Lippincott archive, <em>Large Scale</em> presents more than three hundred photographs of these artists and their iconic works.</p><p>"What is priceless about this book are its photographs, in which workers are diminished in scale by the gigantesque sculptures they are busy fabricating in the dusky light of the Lippincott atelier. They dramatize an aspect of artistic production rarely discussed as such, which gives the book its art historical value." &nbsp;<br>--Arthur C. Danto, philosopher and art critic<br><br>"This book is both an essential historical document and an enchanting souvenir album that takes us back to the quintessentially 1960s moment when America's most interesting sculptors went audaciously large-scale. Much of their work was created at a little-known former factory in North Haven, Connecticut, that became a major fabricator thanks to Don Lippincott--this is his story."<br>--Deborah Solomon, "Questions For" columnist, New York Times MagazineJonathan Lippincott is the design manager at Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

Her life story, with all its highs and lows, provides an opportunity to grow from her tremendous strength, persistence and courage while learning from the challenges she has faced. A widely revered singer/songwriter, Stevie is adored by multiple generations. Interpretation of her songs gives you a look inside her soul but not unless she lets you.

But destiny has great plans for this no-man&#39;s-son, taking him from prophesying before the High King Vortigern to the crowning of Uther Pendragon . . . And the conception of Arthur -- king for once and always.</p><p>Initially published nearly thirty years ago, Mary Stewart's <i>The Crystal Cave</i> has been spellbinding readers and converting them into serious Arthurian buffs ever since. The first in a series of four books, this novel focuses on the early life of Merlin the magician, and the political developments of fifth-century Britain. Not for the fainthearted, this verbose text pays careful attention to historical details and methodical plot development.<p> Merlin's childhood is formed by the absence of his reticent, convent-bound mother and his unnamed and unknown father. As the bastard grandson of a local king, Merlin is the object of both envy and ridicule. His strange powers and predictions earn him greater status as a pariah, and he leaves home as a preadolescent. Returning years later as a young man--empowered by self-knowledge and magic--Merlin finds himself caught in the currents of the shifting kingdoms.</p><p> As an established classic in this genre, and the first in a popular series, <i>The Crystal Cave</i> introduces this familiar character with fresh sensitivity. While readers looking for the romance of <i>First Knight</i> will be disappointed, those happy with tight writing and a complex story line will be satisfied. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>If you haven&#39;t read Mary Stewart&#39;s Arthurian Saga, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

Enraged by injustice, they are each in touch with what is most painful about being human, bound together by their willingness to bring the unspeakable to light.</p><p>Taking the argument into the present are today's women, courageous individuals involved in some of the cruelest realities of our times. Grappling with the existence of honor killing--notably through the stories of Shafilea Ahmed, Fadime Sahindal, and Heshu Yones--Rose argues that the struggles of feminism are far from done. In the final three chapters, Rose celebrates the work of three brilliant contemporary artists--Esther Shalev-Gerz, Yael Bartana, and Th�r�se Oulton--whose work grows out of an unflinching engagement with all that is darkest in the modern world. </p><p><i>Women in Dark Times</i> shows us how these visionary women offer a new template for feminism. Taking their stand against the iniquities of our times, they tread a path between public and private pain, confronting us with what we need most urgently but also often cannot bear to see.</p></p><p><b>Jacqueline Rose</b> is internationally acclaimed as a public intellectual for her writing on feminism, literature, and psychoanalysis and is professor of English, Queen Mary University of London. In the autumn term of 2014 she takes up the Diane Middlebrook and Carl Djerassi Chair in Gender Studies in Cambridge. From January 2015, she will be professor of the humanities at the Institute of the Humanities, Birkbeck, University of London. Her many books include <i>The Haunting of Sylvia Plath</i> and <i>On Not Being Able to Sleep</i>, and a novel, <i>Albertine</i>. She is a regular contributor to the <i>London Review of Books</i>. She lives in London.<p>&#x201c;Provocative . . . a fierce call to action, as Rose challenges women to embrace a new feminism, one that 'would have the courage of its contradictions.'&#x201d; - <i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is the book we have been waiting for--a clarion call for us all, men and women, to be bolder and brasher in our advocacy for change but also more willing to embrace our own contradictions.&#x201d; - Helena Kennedy, <i>QC</i></p><p>&#x201c;A surfeit of elegance and intelligence.&#x201d; - Ali Smith, <i>The Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Formidable . . . It is impossible not to listen carefully to what Professor Rose has to say in her thought-provoking, rigorously argued writing on feminism, literature, and psychoanalysis. In Europe, she is hailed as a public intellectual--she is also acknowledged internationally . . . Rose is indubitably an intellectual of clout . . . It is a breathtaking book and a challenging read--ambitious, scholarly, and innovative, shedding dazzling light on Freud&#x2019;s 'dark continent' of women.&#x201d; - <i>The Herald</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rose's thesis is a measured and decisive stroke in contemporary feminist theory.&#x201d; - <i>Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A rigorously argued and at times breathtaking book . . . Many paragraphs contain a controlled explosion; her analysis of men&#x2019;s fear of and fascination with female sexuality, born from the boy&#x2019;s early proximity to the mother&#x2019;s body, is one of them . . . The book closes with a clarion cry: 'Women have been reasonable for far too long' . . . Her reasoning, ironically, is as tight and sinuous as a constrictor knot. It is a time to be afraid of the dark.&#x201d; - Frances Wilson, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;Brings necessary depth and context to the debate . . . The book provides a valuable record of the ideologies and achievements of women whom society would rather have kept silent, and there are some devastatingly sad passages.&#x201d; - <i>The Independent</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is not an easy book but a lucid, deeply absorbing, and strangely soothing one, in the way that a friend with boundless curiosity, unflinching in the face of difficult truths, always proves more comforting and interesting than the falsely cheerful, draw-up-a-list sort. Rose offers erudite, multiple readings of the lives and work of three very different sets of three women . . . I am persuaded by Rose&#x2019;s argument that women remain best placed to tune in to the chronic insecurity and darkness of modern life.&#x201d; - Melissa Benn, <i>New Statesman</i></p><p>&#x201c;[F]ull of affectionately evoked details . . . The strength of Rose&#x2019;s essays lies in how she teases out the tangled threads in her subjects' lives.&#x201d; - <i>Bookforum</i></p><p>&#x201c;A passionate, powerful . . . manifesto for feminism.&#x201d; - <i>Women's Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Intellectual . . . [Rose] succeeds in shedding light on the unsettling yet profound work of several women--some famous, some unsung--who have searchingly explored, and fatefully confronted, humankind&#x2019;s murkiest instincts.&#x201d; - <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Jacqueline Rose's book <i>Women in Dark Times</i> is pretty amazing.&#x201d; - Irvine Welsh</p><p>&#x201c;Rose confronts dark times with dark and moving stories from the last century inspiring a new feminism for this one. By so doing she keeps alive the dreams of so many women from Rosa Luxemburg and Marilyn Monroe to young girls killed in the name of some perverted sense of 'honor.' Most likely a classic.&#x201d; - Shami Chakrabarti, Director of Liberty</p><p>&#x201c;The portrait of Luxemburg is insightful, exhilarating, and inspiring . . . Her writing about Monroe is a deeply moving defense of a woman on whom the postwar United States projected its dreams and fears . . . The chapter on honor killings is superb, both Rose&#x2019;s dissection of misogynistic attitudes to female sexuality and her exploration of how western society views the crime . . . A book that constantly challenges the reader and forces her to engage with it. Rose&#x2019;s arguments are impossible to ignore.&#x201d; - <i>The Irish Times</i></p></p><h2>The Noble Revolt: The Overthrow of Charles I</h2><p><p>In the 1630s, King Charles I&#x2019;s efforts to expand royal power caused alarm throughout the British Isles.

In fact, she doesn&#39;t like a single thing about this vehicle: not the kids who get on it (&#34;Loud kids. And some of them were the kind who look like meanies&#34;); not the door (&#34;If it closes on you by accident, it will cut you in half, and you will make a squishy sound&#34;); and not the black smoke it emits (&#34;It&#39;s called bus breath, I think&#34;). Other equally candid, on-target perceptions fill Junie B.&#39;s first-person narrative, which is peppered with reader-involving questions (&#34;Only guess what?&#34;; &#34; &#39;Cause guess why?&#34;) that help to propel the story at a whiz-bang pace.

Yet it is open for everyday use, and 365 days a year hosts those who travel to the Vineyard. The Charlotte Inn was restored by Gery and Paula Conover, who live on the property and care for it.

President Thomas Jefferson shared this dream. He conceived the Corps of Discovery to travel up the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains and westward along possible river routes to the Pacific Ocean. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led this expedition of 1804&#x2013;6. Along the way they filled hundreds of notebook pages with observations of the geography, Indian tribes, and natural history of the trans-Mississippi West. <p>In April 1805 Lewis and Clark and their party set out from Fort Mandan following the Missouri River westward. This volume recounts their travels through country never before explored by white people. With new personnel, including the Shoshone Indian woman Sacagawea, her husband Toussaint Charbonneau, and their baby, nicknamed Pomp, the party spent the rest of the spring and early summer toiling up the Missouri. Along the way they portaged the difficult Great Falls, encountered grizzly bears, cataloged new species of plants and animals, and mapped rivers and streams.</p></p><p>Gary E. Moulton is Thomas C.

He went on to become Picture Editor at the Worthington Daily Globe in southern Minnesota. While at the Daily Globe, Brandenburg began freelancing for National Geographic.</p>Grade 3-6-A brief text and incredible full-color photographs tell the story of Brandenburg's Arctic summer excursion, during which he took pictures of a pack of wolves who seemed to accept his presence and allow him to approach them closely. On the day of his departure, the entire pack appeared at the airstrip to witness his leaving, as if to say good-bye. His artfully composed, crisp pictures capture the five-week old puppies' initial explorations outside their den, and their escapades with their baby-sitter, Scruffy, as well as howling practice. He offers intriguing examples of how the pecking order operates; in one dramatic episode, the wolves bring down a musk-ox. Through a series of well-chosen vignettes, the author shares plenty of information about the life cycle of animals, although this is not his main purpose. He clearly wants to communicate his awe for these wild creatures, and hopes to dispel any negative stereotypes that exist in readers' minds. His enthusiasm is evident in every well-chosen word. Laurence Pringle's Wolfman (Scribners, 1983; o.p.) concentrates on the work of one scientist in Minnesota; Scott Barry's The Kingdom of Wolves (Putnam, 1979; o.p.) is a more detailed exploration of the animals' habits. Both are accompanied by black-and-white photographs. Wolves (HarperCollins, 1993) by Seymour Simon offers the basic overview report writers require but To the Top of the World is clearly the most captivating.<br><i> Ellen Fader, Oregon State Library, Salem</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>San Bernardino: The Rise and Fall of a California Community</h2><p>&nbsp;In the mid-1800s San Bernardino emerged as one of the largest settlements in southern California. It surpassed Pueblo de los Angeles and San Diego in grain and lumber yields and boasted a burgeoning cattle industry and promising wine vineyards. But as a Mormon commune&#x2013;the farthest outpost in Brigham Young&#x2019;s Rocky Mountain empire&#x2013;the colony was threatened, and finally abandoned, in 1857 during the Utah war with the United States.<p>From the beginning, Young had misgivings about the colony. Particularly perplexing was the mix of atypical Latter-day Saints who gravitated there. Among these were ex-slave holders; inter-racial polygamists; horse-race gamblers; distillery proprietors; former mountain men, prospectors, and mercenaries; disgruntled Polynesian immigrants; and finally Apostle Amasa M. Lyman, the colony&#x2019;s leader, who became involved in spiritualist seances.</p><p>Despite Young&#x2019;s suspicions, when he issued the call to relocate to Utah, two-thirds of the city&#x2019;s 3,000 residents dutifully obeyed, leaving behind their cumulative fortunes and a city stripped of its regional economic standing. Recounting this remarkable story, Edward Leo Lyman skillfully interweaves the most intriguing details about the setting and chain of events, emphasizing both the significance and irony of this diverse legacy.</p></p><p>&nbsp;Edward Leo Lyman&nbsp;is a professor of history at Victor Valley College in southern California. He is the author of&nbsp;Political Deliverance: The Mormon Quest for Utah Statehood&nbsp;and&nbsp;San Bernardino: The Rise and Fall of a California Community, as well as a short guidebook to Mormon Historical Sites in the San Bernardino Area. He has been published in&nbsp;Arizona and the West,&nbsp;Brigham Young University Studies,&nbsp;California History,&nbsp;<i>Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought</i>,&nbsp;Idaho Yesterdays,&nbsp;Southern California Quarterly, and the&nbsp;Utah Historical Quarterly. He is co-authoring the forthcoming&nbsp;Millard County,&nbsp;Utah: A Centennial History.&nbsp;Southern California Quarterly, Larry E. Burgess<p>A timely new comprehensive study by historian Leo Lyman,&nbsp;<i>San Bernardino: The Rise and Fall of a California Community</i>, brings forth new details and provides fresh insight into the importance of the Mormon colony at San Bernardino and its context in the settlement of the West and southern California. It will serve as the standard interpretation for many years to come.</p><p>A knowledgeable core of regional historians appreciate the importance of the Mormon Colony in San Bernardino in the 1850s and the Colony&#x2019;s significance to the history of southern California. The most complete account of this period was written by George and Helen P. Beattie in 1938 in their book&nbsp;<i>Heritage of the Valley</i>, now long out-of-print and a collector&#x2019;s item.</p><p>With access to the Mormon Church archives and as a descendant of Amasa M. Lyman, one of the Colony&#x2019;s founders, Leo Lyman offers a complete portrait of the San Bernardino settlement&#x2019;s success and the reasons for its abandonment. In four hundred pages, Lyman&#x2019;s evidence illumines the economic imperatives tied to the theological and missionary concerns which led Apostles Lyman and Charles C. Rich to venture forth with a large group of colonists from Salt Lake City in March of 1851. Brigham Young&#x2019;s role, which at first encouraged the proposed Colony as part of a larger goal to have a chain of settlements from Salt Lake City to the Pacific, turned to doubt and reproach at the expedition&#x2019;s start. Young, as the power of approval, is also seen as the spoiler and this is a theme which runs as a connecting skein throughout the narrative.</p><p>Moreover, further complications arise because of Amasa Lyman&#x2019;s friendship and confidence enjoyed with Mormonism&#x2019;s prophet, Joseph Smith. When Young assumed authority as the head of the church, it seems to have provided a tension between the two men and thus transferred tension to the San Bernardino Colony. The complex issues presented in Leo Lyman&#x2019;s account lay in the evolving theological and cultural traditions of the Mormon Church of the time and the larger political relationships between the United States government, the demographics of southern California and the economic and social patterns of the San Bernardino Valley.</p><p>Mountain men&#x2014;such as John Brown, Rube Herring, and James Waters who came into contact with the Mormons leaving Missouri for Utah&#x2014;at first embraced the Mormons and some even ostensibly converted. However, by the time they appeared as part of the Mormon Colony, they developed a political and legal hostility exacerbated by land ownership disputes. These so-called &#x201c;Anti&#x2019;s&#x201d; provided energy for the opposition group populated with Mormons who had been defellowshipped or who had left the Church. Adding to the tension was growing resentment and suspicion on Young&#x2019;s part that material success in San Bernardino came at the cost of spiritual dedication. While President Young was fully willing to use the San Bernardino Colony as a lucrative cash cow for enhancing his work at Salt Lake, he was troubled with reports about Lyman&#x2019;s theological views and increasingly demonstrated a jealous attitude over the success of the Colony.</p><p>Lyman suggests that the &#x201c;Mormon victory in adapting to the life in the semi-arid West is one of the Latter-day Saints&#x2019; contributions to the history of the United States.&#x201d; Success also came because of mutual cooperation and willingness to follow &#x201c;sometimes authoritarian ecclesiastical leaders,&#x201d; he writes. The example of success and industriousness among the Mormons and the respect the Colony enjoyed in southern California provides support for this conclusion.</p><p>By 1858, Young ordered a recall of the Mormon faithful to Utah, and the San Bernardino Colony saw 60% of its population following the injunction. In their tracks, Lyman and Rich left the newly created County of San Bernardino and City of San Bernardino, a thriving agricultural empire&#x2014;embracing flour, wine production, and vegetables, lumbering (Los Angeles was largely built by timber from the San Bernardino Mountains), and roads for the transportation of goods to many points in southern California.</p><p>Discussions of cultural ethnocentrism prevalent at the time, relations with the Californios, the Cahuilla Indians and their Chief Juan Antonio, early African American and Jewish settlers as Mormon colonists, are all afforded their role in the diverse Colony&#x2019;s history. All this made possible because of Lyman&#x2019;s permission to use for the first time archival material in the Church archives.</p><p>In calling San Bernardino&#x2019;s Mormon Colony &#x201c;a community in the truest sense of the word, one of the outstanding examples of selflessness and commitment to others ever demonstrated in American History,&#x201d; Lyman makes a broad reach and might well have added that such comes in contrast, and almost in spite of, the less than helpful stance toward the San Bernardino community from Young&#x2019;s office in Salt Lake City. There is no doubt that outside of Salt Lake City, San Bernardino was the most successful of the Mormon colonies in the West and would have continued to be so had not Young recalled the faithful. The role and nature of a theocracy in nineteenth-century America is presented by Lyman and is contrasted with the inevitable pitfalls when people challenge such authority and frequently pay the price of one&#x2019;s membership in the faith. Lyman&#x2019;s account earns a place on the shelf of works which continue to clarify the evolving understanding of the region called &#x201c;southern California.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Altered Book Scrapbook</h2><p><p>Combine two of the hottest trends in crafts&#x2014;altered books and scrapbooking&#x2014;and you get an exciting technique that&#x2019;s sure to be a hit.

Here, artists contribute 13 different creations, each with annotations, inspirational notes, and one featured technique, whether fashioning Victorian-style postcards or sewing a quilted bookbag for a commissioned project. Variety--and sentiment--rule; the author, for instance, selects her grandmother's teaching textbook to truly reflect her relative's life, complete with marriage license and always-young sepia photographs.

She is the&nbsp;author, editor, or translator of over forty books, including <i>The Surrealist Look: An Erotics of Encounter</i> and <i>The Surrealist Painters and Poets</i>.During what prolific translator and critic Caws (The Surrealist Look; etc.) calls the "Manifesto Moment" from the 1909 publication of the futurist manifesto in Paris's Le Figaro, to Lyubov Popova's suprematist "statement" the manifesto had a "madness about it," but always, even when positing an "us" against a "them," invited the reader to become one of the new breed. Most of the classic ripostes are here, including Whistler's "The Ten O'Clock," several essays by Apollinaire and Marinetti, the dada manifestos by Tzara, the Russian futurists' "Slap in the Face of Public Taste," Pound's "A Few Don't's by an Imagist" and vorticist writings, South American manifestos by Borges and Huidibros, Olson's "Projective Verse," and manifestos of negritude by Cesaire and others. Caws expands the definition of "manifesto" to include milder statements of principles (from the language poets, for example); some poems (parts of Whitman's "Song of Myself"); fragments from the writings of Cage, Duchamp and others; Oscar Wilde's preface to Dorian Gray; Poe's "The Philosophy of Furniture"; one of the few writings of Jacques Vach? Breton's inspiration for surrealism; Schwitters's offbeat "Cow Manifesto" and much more. Though the scholarship feels idiosyncratic, and there are nitpicks to be made about the selections, this enormous book is the perfect companion to the two-volume, international, 20th-century poetry anthology Poems for the Millennium, and is in some ways a more immediate and satisfying portrait of modernist poetics and modernism. (Apr.) Forecast: This book is a guarantee for university libraries, and it will be a steady seller via syllabi in 20th-century poetry, art, politics and history. Its size and relevance to art movements may inspire booksellers to stock it on art book tables; steady sales from the poetry section are also probable, despite the price. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Zoom at Sea</h2><p>Zoom the cat realizes his lifelong dream of nautical adventure in the home of a mysterious woman with magical powers</p><p><b>Tim Wynne-Jones</b> is one of Canada's foremost writers for children.

He lives in Stratford, Ontario.This fanciful nautical adventure stars a winsome cat named Zoom who stays indoors paddling in the sink or sailing in the bathtub all night "when other self-respecting cats are out mousing and howling at the moon." One day Zoom finds in his Uncle Roy's diary a map of "the sea and how to get there," which leads him to the house of the enigmatic Maria. This woman turns wheels, cranks cranks and opens "rows upon rows of tiny doors," letting in the ocean until Zoom cannot "even see the walls of this giant room, only the sun coming up like gold, and silver fish dancing on the waves." Although Zoom doesn't reach his Uncle's ship as he plans, Maria tells him that he can come back, and the reader is assured that "he did. / But that's another tale."

Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody. And for seven years he's been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. <br><br>But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter's world, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish. But only one will live long enough to savor the reward....<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Horror lit's head chef Harris serves up another course in his Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter trilogy, and it's a pi�ce de r�sistance for those with strong stomachs. In the first book, <i>Red Dragon</i> (filmed as <i>Manhunter</i>), Hannibal diabolically helps the FBI track a fascinating serial killer. (Takes one to know one.) In <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, he advises fledgling FBI manhunter Clarice Starling, then makes a bloody, brilliant escape.<p> Years later, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's <i>Inferno</i>.</p><p> Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.</p><p> What happens when the Italian cop gets alone with Hannibal? How does Clarice's reunion with Lecter go from macabre to worse? Suffice it to say that the plot is Harris's weirdest, but it still has his signature mastery of realistic detail. There are flaws: Hannibal's madness gets a motive, which is creepy but lessens his mystery. If you want an exact duplicate of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>'s Clarice/Hannibal duel, you'll miss what's cool about this book--that Hannibal is actually upstaged at points by other monsters. And if you think it's all unprecedentedly horrible, you're right. But note that the horrors are described with exquisite taste. Harris's secret recipe for success is restraint. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In one of the most eagerly anticipated literary events of the decade, Thomas Harris takes us once again into the mind of a killer, crafting a chilling portrait of insidiously evolving evil- a tour de force of psychological suspense.<br><br>Seven years have passed since Dr. Hannibal Lecter escaped from custody, seven years since FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling interviewed him in a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane. The doctor is still at large, pursuing his own ineffable interests, savoring the scents, the essences of an unguarded world. But Starling has never forgotten her encounters with Dr. Lecter, and the metallic rasp of his seldom-used voice still sounds in her dreams.<br><br>Mason Verger remembers Dr. Lecter, too, and is obsessed with revenge. He was Dr. Lecter's sixth victim, and he has survived to rule his own butcher's empire. From his respirator, Verger monitors every twitch in his world-wide web. Soon he sees that to draw the doctor, he must have the most exquisite and innocent-appearing bait; he must have what Dr. Lecter likes best.<br><br>Powerful, hypnotic, utterly original, <b>HANNIBAL</b> is a dazzling feast for the imagination.

JACKSON</p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>behind her eyes</p><p></p><p></p><p>prologue</p><p>Misha hugged herself around her middle. Chills raced down her spine and crystallized the blood in her veins. She felt sick. So sick. Tears streamed from her eyes fast and hard, dripping from her chin as she bent at the waist and cried toward the ground. As she stood in the front yard of his house, confronting him with the video she&#x2019;d found, her body trembled with a shock of grief. &#x201c;How could you do this to me?&#x201d;</p><p>Hunter laughed, a sound of insult as it rumbled up his throat and passed through the smug smile curling his lips. He inclined his head to capture her attention up from her own feet. Like a deer blinded by the light, she froze, locked in the clutches of the blue gaze she&#x2019;d once thought so tender and kind. Now those eyes simmered with derision.</p><p>&#x201c;Knew you had it in you, Misha.&#x201d; His voice raked the taunt, cutting her deeper with each biting word. &#x201c;The good girl act&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I saw right through it. You&#x2019;re just as easy as the rest of the sluts around here, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; His face twisted with morbid satisfaction. &#x201c;Of course that amazing fuck was worth the hundred dollars I had on the line.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A h-h-h-hundred dollars?&#x201d; She stuttered over the question, her tongue thick as she tried to force the words around the shame clogging her throat. Confusion and disbelief spun with the heartbreak. Her knees went weak.</p><p>Hunter moved closer, his nose an inch from hers. &#x201c;A h-h-h-hundred dollars?&#x201d; he mocked, pouring salt into her oldest wounds.</p><p>Misha sucked in a pained breath and squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>&#x201c;What? Do you think you&#x2019;re worth more than that?&#x201d;</p><p>Misha recoiled from the insult.</p><p>He might as well have slapped her.</p><p>He&#x2019;d already ruined her life.</p><p>Abruptly he straightened and took two steps back. &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d; He released a lazy chuckle, casually running a hand through his blond hair like she meant nothing at all. Then he turned and left her there.</p><p>The sob she struggled to hold in broke free, and Misha stumbled over the patchy lawn as heartbreak tore through her.</p><p>Betrayal and humiliation penetrated all the way to her bones. Horror flamed her heated cheeks, streams of tears flowing like a river of fire scalding her flaming flesh. But this heat was nothing like the blush that kissed her skin with shyness, the way the crimson colored her face when the slightest bit of attention was cast on her.</p><p>No.</p><p>Because this? This was anguish.</p><p>Misha couldn&#x2019;t fathom the viciousness, couldn&#x2019;t comprehend that one person could be so cruel. She&#x2019;d believed he&#x2019;d cared about her. Loved her. He&#x2019;d promised her she was everything.</p><p>Turned out she was just a pawn in some sick, twisted game.</p><p></p><p></p><p>chapter one</p><p>Misha</p><p>Three months later</p><p><i>What am I doing here?</i></p><p>I looked up at the dusty blue two-story house&#x2014;the house I&#x2019;d shared with three other girls, Indy, Courtney, and Chloe, during my sophomore year. Nostalgia billowed through me on a soft wave. I&#x2019;d loved so much of my time here, learning how to spread my wings, to fly on my own without the shelter of my parents, who&#x2019;d made it their lifelong duty to protect me from the vile dangers of this world.</p><p>My head shook with remorse. It hadn&#x2019;t taken me long to be ensnared in its traps, had it?</p><p>After Hunter&#x2019;s betrayal, I&#x2019;d run straight home to Wisconsin and right into my mother&#x2019;s waiting arms. Completely crushed. I&#x2019;d sworn to never return here, too ashamed to be seen walking the halls of the university I&#x2019;d attended in Ann Arbor, Michigan, since my freshman year of college.</p><p>Summer had passed in some kind of blur, my heart searching for a way to mend after it had been shattered beyond recognition. No longer did I fully recognize myself. The endless smile was wiped from my mouth and the naive trust I&#x2019;d held in this world disintegrated into nothing.</p><p>But here I was, back in Michigan, standing in the driveway of the house I shared with my roommates. As much as I didn&#x2019;t want to look, I couldn&#x2019;t stop my gaze from wandering, latching warily on to the dingy white house next door.</p><p>Nausea pooled in my stomach as my eyes were drawn up the side of the house to the last window on the second floor. Behind that window was the room where I&#x2019;d given Hunter my innocence. My hand fisted at my side, all of me protesting that thought. No. Where Hunter had <i>stolen </i>my innocence. Behind that window was where he&#x2019;d hurt me, humiliated and shamed me.</p><p>For all my life I&#x2019;d seen the best in people. My mother had always told me it was what made me who I was, why I glowed and smiled and shed a radiant light on the rest of the world. She said it was what made me good and begged me to never let it go.</p><p>Hunter taught me it just made me a fool.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are.&#x201d;</p><p>Tearing my eyes away, I turned to Indy as she stepped out onto the front porch of the house. Red hair whipped around her face, green eyes watching me where I stood at the end of the walkway.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time you got here. It&#x2019;s Happy Hour and we&#x2019;re making drinks. Get your ass inside.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt the heat rush to my face, and I chewed at my bottom lip, grabbed the two suitcases I&#x2019;d taken from my car, and began to haul them behind me.</p><p>Happy Hour.</p><p>Ha.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t truly been happy since I left this place three months ago.</p><p>Junior year started in just three days. I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be a part of it, resigning myself to giving up my dreams and transferring to a small school in Wisconsin, never turning back. Indy had convinced me I was wrong. She&#x2019;d been betrayed, too, her jerk of a boyfriend hurting her, and she needed me back in the house. Just as much as I needed to be here.</p><p>I&#x2019;d missed it. Now that I was here, I could admit that I knew I didn&#x2019;t want to run away. By my doing so, all I had accomplished was allowing Hunter to win his nasty game.</p><p>He&#x2019;d stolen something precious from me. I wouldn&#x2019;t let him steal the internship I&#x2019;d worked so hard for, too. Helping the kids there was the most important thing in my life, the one true thing that had called me back to Michigan. I couldn&#x2019;t rid those innocent little faces from swirling through my mind, those little kids being the ones I planned on dedicating my life to.</p><p>No, I wouldn&#x2019;t allow him to steal them, too.</p><p>The final key had been Indy telling me Hunter had been booted from the house next door, voted out when his three roommates found out he was the one who&#x2019;d been responsible.</p><p>My heart warmed in a way I thought was no longer possible. I still couldn&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;d taken up my side, supported me after I&#x2019;d been so gullible.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t mean I loved the idea of someone else there, living in that room where I had been played like a cheap, worn-out piano.</p><p>Condemned.</p><p>That was what I wanted it to be. The room should be taped off and boarded up so no one could enter its repulsive walls. Even better, pummeled into a million tiny pieces by a wrecking ball. Maybe then the memory of what had happened there would be pulverized along with it.</p><p>I knew he would still roam the campus, that some people would think me someone I was not, that there would be times when I&#x2019;d bear the brunt of the curse he&#x2019;d cast on me. But I took comfort in knowing I wouldn&#x2019;t have to witness that same smug, self-satisfied expression he&#x2019;d looked at me with when I confronted him, when he laughed and mocked me, tossing me aside like a piece of trash.</p><p>Never again would I allow myself to fall prey to a guy like that. Lesson learned&#x2014;the hard way.</p><p>I ascended the five wooden steps to the covered porch, my suitcases bouncing as I dragged them up behind me. I let them go and hugged Indy.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; she whispered near my ear.</p><p>I squeezed her tighter, sad the two of us were sharing in some kind of brokenhearted kinship.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry to hear about Dean,&#x201d; I mumbled into her shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Me, too.&#x201d; She pulled away, swiping away a tear. She gestured toward the door. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s get your stuff inside and then we need to catch up.&#x201d;</p><p>I followed her through the front door. Inside, the main room was cramped with three couches. We spent a lot of time here, watching TV, lounging, and talking, sometimes studying, and this was where our friends hung out when they came over.</p><p>One of our other roommates, Chloe, sat on one of the couches, typing furiously on her laptop. She glanced up, squealed when she saw me in the doorway. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re back!&#x201d;</p><p>She set her laptop aside and hopped up to welcome me.</p><p>I hugged her. &#x201c;Thanks for letting me come back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pshh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She smiled a playful smile, waves of her short blond hair swishing around her face. &#x201c;Like we wanted to go through the trouble of looking for a new roommate.&#x201d;</p><p>Courtney, the last of my roommates, ducked her head through the opening to the kitchen. &#x201c;Misha&#x2019;s back!&#x201d; Her statement was no question, but tossed out in a loud greeting. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know how glad I am that Indy was able to drag you back here where you belong.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no question they were working to play it light, to pretend like this heaviness didn&#x2019;t surround me, like tears wouldn&#x2019;t fall at the drop of a dime or at the mention of his name.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to be back,&#x201d; I forced myself to say, doing my best to make it the truth. I smiled softly at them all. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go upstairs and get settled.&#x201d;</p><p>Courtney nodded. &#x201c;Just let us know if you need anything. Indy and I are making drinks. We require your presence in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She studied her watchless wrist. &#x201c;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two point five minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>I giggled, feeling another flare of redness seep to my cheeks, and I self-consciously blew back a thick black curl that had fallen in my face. &#x201c;How about five?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Deal.&#x201d;</p><p>I headed upstairs. On each side of the hall were two doors, four bedrooms taking up the second floor. Straight back at the end of the hall was a bathroom and a door to the side that led up to the open attic. We&#x2019;d stuffed it full of pillows of every size, the floor just one huge, soft, squishy mess. I loved to escape to its quiet sanctuary, to maybe get lost in a book, to set myself free in my imagination.</p><p>After Hunter, I was sure I&#x2019;d be hiding out up there a lot, stowed and locked away from all the things I didn&#x2019;t want to face.</p><p>Sadness swallowed me when I opened the second door on the right and let myself into my small room. Everything was how I&#x2019;d left it, minus the pictures I&#x2019;d torn from the walls and the belongings I&#x2019;d shoved into plastic bags that night three months ago when I left as quickly as I could, completely broken and having no clue how I&#x2019;d go on, sure I would never come back to this place I loved.</p><p>Standing in the silence of my room, I made a resolution that I now would go on.</p><p>And I&#x2019;d never allow myself to be so vulnerable again.</p><p></p><p></p><p>chapter two</p><p>Misha</p><p>Sucking in a steadying breath, I hiked my backpack higher up on my shoulders. My hand fluttered on the front doorknob. The cool metal beneath my palm passed through me like some kind of warning I couldn&#x2019;t shake.</p><p>My first class of the semester started in an hour. I knew I had to make it out this door, hold my chin up, and face the world that I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the world I really didn&#x2019;t want to face.</p><p>But I hadn&#x2019;t come back here to be a coward, to become some kind of pathetic, reclusive girl who holed herself up in her room like I&#x2019;d been doing since I came back to this house three days ago. I hated feeling like this, my heart all twisted up in my ribs, pounding so hard I was pretty sure I could see it beating under my shirt. Nerves wobbled my legs, my breaths heaving as they panted in and out of my parted lips.</p><p><i>I can do this.</i></p><p>I forced myself to turn the knob and stepped out onto the covered porch. The soles of my shoes thudded on the wooden floor, echoing as I propelled myself across the deck.</p><p><i>I can do this,</i> I chanted over and over, my lips moving without sound as I studied my feet.</p><p>At the edge of the porch, I stepped down onto the top step and into the light. The light I hadn&#x2019;t seen in days, my blinds drawn and my room cloaked in shadows for too long, the overbearing darkness filling me with melancholy and fear and questions of whether I really should have returned.</p><p>Now rays of shimmering sunlight beat down, wrapping me up in a soft hug of warmth, embracing my pale skin. Goose bumps lifted on my arms as the days I&#x2019;d spent in dread seemed to clash with the greeting of the sun.</p><p>I lifted my face to the sky, my eyes dropping closed as I relished the sweet feel of the cool breeze and warm sun that tickled gentle fingers of comfort across my face.</p><p>And I stood in awed welcome of the day.</p><p>Winter would be here soon enough, ushering in the cold. This beautiful day was a stark reminder that I couldn&#x2019;t allow Hunter to steal the best of life from me. Hiding in my room just meant I was again allowing him to take another piece of myself by giving in to the worry and questions.</p><p>I pulled the deepest breath into the well of my lungs. Clean, crisp air filled me up like a soothing balm that could be inhaled, a tangible solace that could be tucked somewhere deep inside myself, becoming a vital piece of who I was.</p><p>Something I hadn&#x2019;t felt in so long stirred in my heart. A swirl of joy blossomed in my belly, sending a swell of appreciation right along with it. A feeling that everything might just be okay quietly slipped through my body on a hushed wave.</p><p>&#x201c;I can do this,&#x201d; I whispered again, only this time I uttered it aloud, the encouragement ringing through my ears to give a boost of confidence to my downtrodden spirit.</p><p>This time I believed it.</p><p>Slowly my eyes blinked open to the bright blue canopy above, and I shook myself off, skipped down the steps. I headed down the walkway leading away from the house, my face downturned and focused on my white canvas shoes.</p><p>Awareness prickled along my spine, lifting the hairs at the nape of my neck. On its own accord, my head drifted to the side where the upheaval of energy radiated, barreling into every last one of my senses.</p><p>I slowed to a stop.</p><p>It was doubtful anything in this world could have forced me to keep walking.</p><p>My lips parted in surprise, and a little &#x201c;Oh&#x201d; dropped from my mouth. My heart stuttered and all the heat of the sun landed square on my face, my cheeks flaming so hot I felt it burn somewhere in my stomach.</p><p>In the driveway next door sat a car I&#x2019;d never seen before, one I didn&#x2019;t recognize, one there was no question I would have remembered had it ever appeared in my sight. It was completely blacked out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the windows and the wheels and the body.

For centuries the pub has been an essential part of London&#x2019;s cultural and social fabric. This beautifully illustrated book takes readers through the doors of 25 historically and architecturally significant London pubs. Through photographs specially commissioned for this project, readers can explore these institutions&#x2014;from snob screens to 400-hundred-year-old flagstone floors. Engaging texts highlight what makes each pub so special, their place in London&#x2019;s history, the personalities who have frequented them, the events that occurred inside, and the ways pubs have contributed phrases such as "on the wagon" and "one for the road" to the modern lexicon. This book reveals why the Lamb and Flag in Covent Garden earned the nickname the "Bucket of Blood," and features a pub that Charles Dickens described as a "great rambling queer old place". Furthermore, the book muses over the chances that Casanova paid a visit to The Dog and Duck in Soho, and uncovers the location of Charles De Gaulle&#x2019;s favorite wartime watering hole. These and other amusing anecdotal histories make this fascinating and luxuriously illustrated book a must-have for anyone with a love for the good old London pub.</p><p>George Dailey has more than forty years of experience in the food and drink industry. One of the pioneers of the modern English gastropub, he continues to run successful destination inns in Oxfordshire."I suggest you check out Great Pubs of London &#x2013; a delightful coffee table book, photographed by the wonderful Charlie Dailey... It&#x2019;s a beautiful celebration of the capital&#x2019;s most historic watering holes." &#x2013;Richard Branson, <i>Virgin<br></i><br>"When thoughts turn to ale, images from London pubs spring to mind. Embodying that rare quality of romance combined with heritage and 'oblivion of care and freedom from solitude'(from Dr. Samuel Johnson) a London pub delivers as no other can. George Dailey's lavish collection of pubs and stories nearly suffices to re-create that experience so may miles away, while the dark days of winter threaten. Getting lost in the gorgeous photography expands the pleasure of the pint of ale so readily at hand." <i>-All About Beer<br><br></i>"If you&#x2019;re planning a trip to London, went a decade ago and miss the scene, or just want a really pretty coffee table book about booze, then&nbsp;<i>Great Pubs of London</i>&nbsp;is for you." -<i>The Manual</i></p><h2>The Oresteia</h2><p>A poetic new interpretation of the ancient dramatic trilogy about the house of Atreus describes how King Agamemnon is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and the efforts of their son, Orestes, to kill his mother and avenge the crime, bringing upon himself the wrath of the Furies and the judgment of Athens.</p><p>During the final years of his life, Ted Hughes poured much of his energy into translating the classics. Given the triumph of the <i>Birthday Letters</i>, some readers may regret this canonical moonlighting. Yet it's hard to feel shortchanged by the work Hughes did produce: his version of Ovid was a brilliant blend of Latinate suavity and contemporary grit, and he negotiated the alexandrines of Racine's <i>Ph�dre</i> with spectacular ease. Now we have his translation of the <i>Oresteia</i>, which was commissioned by the Royal National Theater in the late 1990s. Has Hughes done right by Aeschylus?<p> The answer would have to be yes--with a couple of qualifications. Hughes made no secret of the fact that he was after an "acting version" of the trilogy, one that would convey the power of Aeschylus's classic bloodbath to a modern audience. He has therefore taken more liberties with the text than we might expect, chopping and channeling the original to fit his own conception. Perhaps the result is closer to what Robert Lowell called an "imitation"--an attempt to capture the work's spirit without precisely mimicking its form. In any case, this <i>Oresteia</i> succeeds on both counts. The darkness and destructive movement of the original remain intact in the Hughes's free-verse lines: </p><blockquote> The men of Troy are a litter of corpses,<br> Rubbish-heaps of corpses. Troy on its hill<br> Cascades with blood, as under a downpour<br> Of bodies from the heavens,<br> Shattered and entangled with each other<br> In every passage--mutilations,<br> Amputations, eviscerations. The women<br> Are kneeling, shoulders heaving, with eyes hidden,<br> Over what were yesterday<br> Husbands, fathers, sons.<br> They labour at a grief that is already<br> The first labour of slaves.<br> </blockquote> Yet Hughes has also left his elemental imprint on the play. Always drawn to violence in his own verse--particularly the impersonal assault and battery of the natural world--he has made his <i>Oresteia</i> more bloody-minded than the original (and that's saying something). There's nothing sensationalistic about this extra quantum of wrack and ruin. It's merely Hughes's personal response to Aeschylus--and a necessary preparation, perhaps, for Athena's clarifying cameo at the end of <i>The Eumenides</i>: "Let your rage pass into understanding / As into the coloured clouds of a sunset, / Promising a fair tomorrow. / Do not let it fall / As a rain of sterility and anguish / On Attica." Her plea for conciliation is as powerful as the horrors that have preceded it, which may (to tread on some rather thin biographical ice) reflect the poet's own final impulses. In any case, this is passionate, memorable, deeply human poetry--i.e., what becomes a classic most. <i>--Anita Urquhart</i>Ted Hughes is Poet Laureate to Queen Elizabeth II.

For tonight, in Bethlehem, a child has been born, a savior who is Christ the Lord." When the shepherds are invited to follow the star to visit the child, one young boy is told to stay and mind the flock. But the Angel Gabriel returns for him, taking the boy on a magical, memorable flight to be the first to witness the Christmas miracle. With a gently wry narration by Michael Morpurgo and expressive illustrations by the extraordinary Quentin Blake, this inviting, uplifting story is destined to become a holiday tradition.</p><p>Michael Morpurgo, a recent British Children&#x2019;s Laureate, has written more than ninety books for children, including retellings SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT and BEOWULF.

He lives in London.Starred Review. The truth is that once we weren't children anymore, we never did believe Grandpa's story, not really&#x2014;as much as we might have wanted to.... We still loved listening to it, though. Christmas nights would never have been the same without it. Voiced by an indulgent but typically skeptical youth, these opening lines frame a captivating retelling of the Nativity as experienced by the youngest shepherd, whose father and uncles have left him behind to look after the flock as they follow the star to Bethlehem. When the angel Gabriel overhears the boy's lamenting the unfairness of it all, he drops in to make things a little fairer and whisk the boy to the manger and back, lickety-split. Morpurgo's tone blends reverence with wit, a combination matched in Blake's pen-and-ink and watercolor cartoons of heavenly choruses, zooming angels and the boy shepherd holding an infant Jesus (he hopes against hope that [the baby] wouldn't cry). The six-inch-square trim size spells gift book; would-be givers should note the religious nature of the ending.

Buckley.... <br><br> Eventually, Random House chief Bennett Cerf would appoint Schiffrin to head the very imprint founded by his father and Kurt Wolff&#x2014;Pantheon. There, Schiffrin would publish some of the world&#x2019;s leading writers, from Noam Chomsky, Michel Foucault, and Eric Hobsbawm, to Simone De Beauvoir, Studs Terkel, Art Spiegelman, and Marguerite Duras. <br><br> But, in a move that made headlines, Schiffrin would ultimately rebel at corporate ownership and form his own publishing house&#x2014;The New Press&#x2014;where he would go on to set a new standard for publishing independence. <br><br><em>A Political Education</em> is a fascinating intellectual memoir that tells not only the story of a unique and important literary figure, but provides an absorbing account of the tumultuous political times that shaped him. <br></p></p><p>Andr� Schiffrin was born in Paris, the son of a prominent publisher, but fled with his family for the US when the Nazis occupied France.

Michael has been summoned to the city by his bishop, but it isn&#39;t until they arrive that they discover the reason - the bishop has been accused of murder. The charge seems ludicrous, but Michael takes the investigation seriously and energetically sets about his task. Almost immediately he discovers that there appears to have been a series of unexplained deaths in the area. At the same time Bartholomew comes across an underground movement of rebellion against the church and the tithes they demand from the laity, and the two men also learn that there has been a spate of burglaries which are being blamed on a band of travellers. Then a fellow of the priory is murdered almost under their noses. Can this death be connected to the others? Are all the killings linked to the burgeoning rebellion in the city?

Probably, but Lemony Snicket has not written one.</p></p><p><p> Lemony Snicket claims he was nowhere near the scene of the crime. He is the author of several other unpleasant stories, including those in the bestselling A Series of Unfortunate Events and <i>The Lump of Coal</i>. </p>Just in time for the full-on onslaught of holiday sentimentality, Lemony Snicket comes to the rescue, offering up an acerbic miniature picture book that hides a droll sweetness beneath a biting sardonic wit. It&#x2019;s December again, and our hero, a lump of coal with an identity crisis (inexplicably wearing a tuxedo) is off in search of a miracle that will give meaning to his life. He tries an art gallery; perhaps he could smudge himself across a canvas masterpiece. No go. He tries a Korean barbecue; maybe he can fuel the fire that roasts eggplant and warms holiday hearts. Nope. At last, a drug-store Santa claims him as the perfect addition to his disobedient stepson&#x2019;s stocking, and the coal lump finds his place in the world. The tongue-in-cheek narrative receives able support&nbsp;from Helquist&#x2019;s full-color illustrations, which nicely extend the humor.

[a] moving narrative of friendships broken by war and betrayal&#39; Sunday Times 1938. A perfect summer on the Greek island of Lefkas for three young people untroubled by the simmering politics of Europe. Peter, visiting from Germany while his father leads an archaeological dig, has become close friends with locals Andreas and Eleni. As the world slides towards conflict and Peter is forced to leave, they swear to meet again. 1943: Andreas and Eleni have joined the partisan forces resisting the German invasion. Peter has returned - now a dangerously well-informed enemy intelligence officer. A friendship formed in peace will turn into a desperate battle between enemies sworn to sacrifice everything for the countries that they love... &#39;Simon Scarrow has done it again: another barnstorming book that speaks not only of the horror of war, but the ultimate heroism and self-sacrifice of those caught up in it. The glory of Simon&#39;s books is that they can be read on so many levels: yes, they are thrilling in its truest sense, there are characters we care about deeply and they are under constant threat. But alongside this are the vignettes of a life clearly viewed, the threads of sharp social observation that set his historical thrillers apart from the greater mass.&#39; Manda Scott</p><p>Simon Scarrow is a Sunday Times No. 1 bestselling author. He has a great passion for history, and has brought a number of different eras vividly to life in his acclaimed and much-loved fiction, from the days of the Roman Empire in CENTURION and BROTHERS IN BLOOD, to the times of the Duke of Wellington and Napoleon Bonaparte in the quartet including YOUNG BLOODS and FIRE AND SWORD, to the Siege of Malta in the sixteenth century with SWORD &amp; SCIMITAR. His portrayal of an idyllic world torn apart by war in HEARTS OF STONE is powerful, authentic and unforgettable, and shows one of our finest authors of historical fiction at the height of his powers.

Amma refused to buy one from the boys&#x2019; section, pushed me instead toward the pinks and butterflies in the girls&#x2019;, so I told her I needed one for a school play. I wore it open when I biked down hills, the wind slipping its fingers through the loose weave, cooling my sweat through my tank top. My best friend Nisha told me I&#x2019;d make a cute boy, and her words squeezed something deep inside my bones, pried loose the skin between my legs. Pin pricks. Needles. My first lie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Music pumps from the walls and jumps off the tin roof tiles. Gay night at the local dive, and it&#x2019;s a clash of rainbow shirts against walls of dusty license plates. College lesbians and blue-collar queers slide around each other in the hot, coffin-shaped bar. Hands slip numbers over sticky tables, roaming thumbs hook over edges of rough denim, drunken tongues on beads of sweat, lips mix over whispered lies, skin on skin without room for truths and this is why we&#x2019;re here.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; Kris says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look.&#x201d; He leans my way over a tall, spindly table and sips his long island iced tea through a stirrer held between his teeth. His hair, which he grows out into a swoop over his left eye, falls down between us like a curtain. We&#x2019;ve both taken off our wedding rings. Mine rests in a tiny glass tray in our bathroom. Kris&#x2019;s is placed carefully on his nightstand next to his multivitamins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The walls vibrate with the bass, bouncing across my skin. I drink my beer and check my phone, wondering if it&#x2019;s my ex calling, but it&#x2019;s only my mother.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Your two o&#x2019;clock, or mine?&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mine.&#x201d; Kris shakes the hair out of his eyes and points at my phone. &#x201c;Is it Emily?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I put my phone back in my pocket. It&#x2019;s only been a couple of weeks since Emily and I broke up, but the time has stretched me out. My insides feel ragged and thin. I want the dance floor to swell up with people, the music to climb inside me and wipe my brain clean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris stares hard at his glass, now mostly filled with ice, the dark tea slurped down to the last inch. Even at twenty-seven, he is still all angles that push at his clothing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drain the last of my beer and walk toward the bar. Kris&#x2019;s two o&#x2019;clock is a man sitting at the table next to ours in a Red Sox hat and a white Hanes shirt. He holds his Bud Light to his lips but doesn&#x2019;t drink.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk up next to a woman on a bar stool whose sad eyes droop down at the outer corners like they&#x2019;re going to tip the pupils right out of her face. My phone buzzes. I ignore it. The woman smiles at me, her mouth edged in red lipstick. I could take her into a bathroom stall and push her up against the cold brick walls. I think of that red, red mouth gaping open, lipstick smeared, fingers clutching at me, lips slippery on my fingers and mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smile back. She slides her bar stool closer and touches my arm when she talks, her fingers tingling the skin where I&#x2019;ve pushed up the sleeves of my button-down. Kris would say it was worth it. A fuck&#x2019;s a fuck, he would say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My phone buzzes. Amma again. I leave the woman smiling and walk back to where Kris is standing, stirring the ice in his glass around and around. This is the first time we&#x2019;ve gone out in months&#x2014;my unemployment and his busy work schedule as a second-pass message editor for a greeting card company keeps us out of the bars and at home doing normal married people things like Amma always wanted. Kris spends his nights trying to write his own greetings and staring at the cards framed over his desk, the few he got published when he first left engineering and started in this business. I spend my nights drawing commissions for horny suburban fanboys with money to waste&#x2014;too-thin elves facing off against tentacled monsters, custom Sailor Scouts, coy anime girls frolicking at the beach, well-endowed geishas undressing in dimly-lit rooms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So?&#x201d; Kris says. He tips his glass back and shakes an ice cube into his mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The one at the bar? I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A fuck&#x2019;s a fuck.&#x201d; He holds the ice cube between his teeth and talks around it. &#x201c;Emily&#x2019;s getting laid. Why shouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Shut up.&#x201d; I wish I had bought another beer so that I&#x2019;d have something to hold onto, so that the cold of it could take my mind off the ache in my stomach. My hands grasp at the air.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the Red Sox hat stares hard at Kris through the darkness of the bar.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Emily was no Nisha,&#x201d; Kris says. He raises his empty glass. &#x201c;To Nisha, your oldest and truest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel the outline of my phone through my pocket and think about calling Nisha.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Red Sox Hat seems interested,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s drinking a Bud Light.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A fuck&#x2019;s a fuck.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven&#x2019;t spoken to Nisha since my wedding, haven&#x2019;t had a meaningful conversation with her since we graduated from high school four years before that. I tap my fingers on the table. What would she say if I called her now?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not bad looking.&#x201d; Kris tucks a piece of hair behind his ear and looks again at the man, letting his gaze linger. He crunches down on another ice cube. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming over.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Sox Hat puts his enormous biceps on our table, which creaks under the pressure. He&#x2019;s younger-looking close up, probably still in his early twenties, still in college. Kris sits up a bit straighter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man smirks at me and says, &#x201c;Can I buy you a drink?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I can react, Kris reaches across the table and folds his fingers over my wrist. My phone buzzes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s mine,&#x201d; Kris says.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Sox Hat gets up off the table and looks from Kris to me and back to Kris. &#x201c;My mistake.&#x201d; He walks back to his table.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrench myself from Kris&#x2019;s grip. He puts his forehead in his hands.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I thought he was looking at you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris nods to the table. I rub my wrist where he held it. We have an agreement that he&#x2019;ll intervene if guys hit on me, but he overdoes it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I knew these boots were a bad idea,&#x201d; I say. Kris had picked them out. &#x201c;I look straight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How&#x2019;s this for a greeting? Roses are red, violets are blue.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is now really the time?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Every guy I like just wants to sleep with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Wonderful.

Focusing on the relation of theology to postcolonial theory, Postcolonial Theologies brings together a wide diversity of authors, many of them fresh and exciting theological voices, in essays that are stunningly creative and prophetically lucid. All essays are theologically constructive, not merely deconstructive or critical, in their visions for Christianity. Forming a sort of doctrinal landscape, they emerge under the themes of theological anthropology shaped by ethnicity, class, and privilege; a Christology that intersects the claims of Christ and empire; and a Cosmology that imagines a postcolonial world.</p><p><p>Catherine Keller is professor of constructive theology at Caspersen Graduate School of Drew University and steers the Transdisciplinary Theological Colloquium, from which this book emerged.</p><p>Michael Nausner is an ordained United Methodist minister and has taught at Drew University and Forham University.</p>&#34;Postcolonial Theologies was a worthwhile &#39;expenditure&#39; of my jealously guarded reading time. Within its pages one will encounter both established and emergent voices in theological studies taking on the age-old, ever-mutating but always expanding realities of Empire. This book deftly uses postcolonial theory not only to deconstruct, but (re) construct theological reflection; in addition, it not only &#39;applies&#39; postcolonial theory to theology but also explores what theology may contribute to postcolonial inquiry. There are fresh and refreshing ruminations on theological anthropology, christology, and divinity, but also captivating contentions with pressing issues of our times like disability, diversity, ecology, and the global economy.&#34;</p><h2>Learn to Paint Flowers in Pastel (Collins Learn to Paint)</h2><p>In this book the author, President of the Pastel Society, portrays the excitement of working with pastels to create vibrant and colourful images of flowers.

Once limited to a small number of zealous adherents, veganism has become steadily more mainstream.

The articles are based on reviewing cognitive psychology literature concerning how people process information to make judgments on incomplete and ambiguous information. Richard Heur has selected the experiments and findings that seem most relevant to intelligence analysis and most in need of communication to intelligence analysts. He then translates the technical reports into language that intelligence analysts can understand and interpreted the relevance of these findings to the problems intelligence analysts face.</p><p>Richards J. Heuer, Jr., worked for the CIA for nearly 45 years-first as a staff officer from 1951 until his retirement in 1979, and then as a contractor on a variety of projects until 1995.

And so, although gentle little Daisy now lived in an ungodly home, she had not forgotten how her parents had brought her up in the Lord. One feature of life she had never experienced in her home with her parents was foul language. While trying to make some income by selling flowers on a street corner, Daisy heard much awful talk from the people who passed by. One day, her tender, childlike rebuke to a man named General Forster, deeply touched his heart. He came to understand the sinfulness of taking God&#39;s name in vain. The changes in General Forster were huge! But could Daisy have ever imagined that one day, this changed man would adopt her as his very own daughter?

Enormously popular among New England readers, the tale in various versions appeared in no fewer than nineteen editions over that brief four-year span. This new edition appends three other contemporary accounts of cross-dressing and urban vice which, together with <i>The Female Marine</i>, provide a unique portrayal of prostitution and interracial city life in early-nineteenth-century America.<br><br>The alternately racy and moralistic narrative recounts the adventures of a young woman from rural Massachusetts who is seduced by a false-hearted lover, flees to Boston, and is entrapped in a brothel. She eventually escapes by disguising herself as a man and serves with distinction on board the U.S. frigate <i>Constitution</i> during the War of 1812. After subsequent onshore adventures in and out of male dress, she is happily married to a wealthy New York gentleman.<br><br>In his introduction, Daniel A. Cohen situates the story in both its literary and historical contexts. He explains how the tale draws upon a number of popular Anglo-American literary genres, including the female warrior narrative, the sentimental novel, and the urban expos�. He then explores how <i>The Female Marine</i> reflects early-nineteenth-century anxieties concerning changing gender norms, the expansion of urban prostitution, the growth of Boston's African American community, and feelings of guilt aroused by New England's notoriously unpatriotic activities during the War of 1812.</p><p>First published in 1815, <i>The Female Marine</i> purported to be the autobiography of a woman who, in order to escape the shame of having a child out of wedlock and subsequent work as a prostitute, disguised herself as a boy and joined the Marines. The popularity of this narrative led to its being reprinted 19 times in 3 years and gave rise to a series of sequels, also included in this modern edition. This is a lively tale full of duels, piracy, and swashbuckling. It is also a sobering study about what a woman in early 19th-century America had to do to achieve some level of independence. Cross-dressing for this protagonist is not about performing; it is about saving her life. In addition to the action-filled plot and astute cultural observations, this book has wonderfully florid 19th-century prose that makes it appropriate for reading aloud.Associate professor of history at Florida International University, Daniel A.

To keep from burning, they sing a special song and when they can no longer bear the heat, they call their friends to pull them out. Iktomi convinces them to all play at the same time, promising to let them out when they get too hot. But in his typical fashion, he tricks the animals, releasing only a single pregnant prairie dog, ensuring future meals. While the rascal prepares to dine, a seemingly injured Coyote challenges him to a race. He quickly agrees and is easily outwitted, losing his ill-gotten feast. Goble's tale unfolds in the traditional call-and-response pattern of oral storytellers. Wonderfully designed pages with impeccably rendered ink-and-watercolor figures and varied typography lend a visual hand in the telling of this multilayered story. New and old cultural elements and plenty of humor are included, but Iktomi's comment about wishing he had brought along his "AK-47" is particularly jarring and the images of the cooked creatures are not for readers with weak stomachs. Still, kids will enjoy being in the know as they follow the humorous and inevitable downfall of this dubious hero.<br><i>Paula A.

It is a tender and loving tribute to &#39;Nature&#39;s great masterpiece... The only harmless great thing&#39;, as John Donne described the elephant, as well as an insight into one of the forgotten battlegrounds of the war.&#39; LITERARY REVIEW &#39;This novel is based on a little-known true story of the Second World War when a herd of 53 elephants was used by a young English schoolteacher to rescue a band of orphans in Burma and transport them to the safety of India. Their incredible journey is filled with adventure, tragedy and love, as you might expect. But, most thrilling of all is the emergence of the elephants as real characters with distinct personalities. This is not done in a sentimental Jungle Book kind of way. Rather, it is true to Darwin&#39;s description of these creatures as being possessed of many of the same senses as humans, including the capacity for jealousy, suspicion and revenge. The author - who is also an award-winning Panorama reporter - takes advantage of this phenomenon and scores a bull&#39;s-eye with an excellent and ingenious plot.&#39; DAILY MAIL &#39;A deftly realised on-the-road novel alive with the horrors of war.&#39; YORKSHIRE EVENING POST</p><h2>Among the Thugs</h2><p>They have names like Barmy Bernie, Daft Donald, and Steamin&#39; Sammy.

Posted to Gibraltar in the midst of war, he flew sorties in support of the North African landings during Operation Torch, a particularly interesting episode in Second World War history. From here, he was to work on the iconic Catalina &#x2013; the spectacular water plane, employed to such great effect in an array of military operations in the latter half of the Twentieth Century. His exploits are relayed in vivid, first hand detail, offering fresh insights into this period of history from a man engaged at the heart of the action. Post war exploits flow into accounts of wartime engagement, and there is space too in which to detail John's post-war career behind the Iron Curtain.<br><br>Diary entries, edited and complied by his grandson Anthony Holt, have been lovingly woven together to create a complete narrative which spans a career of such wide variety and achievement to make it perfect material for a book such as this.</p><p>John French is an author and historian.<br><br>Catalina Over Arctic Oceans, John French, 9781781590539, P&amp;S This is a quality publication, with a striking cover picture of the sea plane and the enemy u-boat and photos of the author that will fire the interest of those who see the book.

Janet died in 1994 and Allan, a former teacher, now lives in London."There was once a baby who had no mommy . . . He fed himself and bathed himself. He even changed his own diaper." So begins a modern quest in which the baby sets out to find a mother. Along the way he encounters a cat, a teddy, a wind-up hen, and an old uncle, all of whom join the hunt until they find a woman pushing an empty baby carriage. All settle very comfortably in a snug house where the uncle reads a story . . .about a baby who had no father. So they start out again. Unfortunately, the second quest doesn't work as well. While the search for the "mommy" follows folklore tradition with questions, answers, and reasoning, the search for the father is so foreshortened that it hardly makes sense and has no rhythmic quality to the telling. It seems tacked on as an afterthought, giving the story a forced and hurried ending. The whimsical watercolors are some of Ahlberg's best, however, and the delightful humor of the story and the child-pleasing role reversal at the beginning (the picture of the baby diapering himself is especially endearing) make this a worthwhile purchase. --Connie C.

The author, a professional photographers and writer, spent many years in Central America gathering material and documenting the various types of fabrics currently being made. The book shows the men and women at work producing woven garments and lengths of cloth, their looms and weaving setups and their materials. Special emphasis is placed on the specific techniques used to weave different kinds of cloth, especially supplementary weft patterning, long considered the highest achievement of Guatemalan weavers. After a brief review of the origins and history of Guatemalan weaving, the author discusses the background of the craft today, the lifestyle of the weaver, the traditional uses of the textiles, and recent weaving trends. The next chapter describes the different fibers used in textile production: how they are spun and dyed, and what types of looms and weaving apparatus are used. The various approaches to weaving throughout Guatemala are described and compared in a lengthy chapter on backstrap weaving (which includes techniques used in patter weaves, brocades, and gauze). A chapter on floor-loom weaving shows the equipment and weaving techniques for plain-weave, tapestry, and Jacquard-loom weaving, among others. The author also describes looping, embroidery, knitting, and crochet used for making bags and nets. The conclusion surveys new directions in Guatemalan weaving. The book conveys both the glory of the cloth produced and a portrait of the patience, skill, and exacting demands of the weaving craft. 225 black-and-white illustrations. 8 pages of color. Glossary.

A brawl broke out and a man named Matti was accidentally killed. When he questions the villagers, Torsson notices some minor discrepancies in their stories, but writes them off as unimportant. It is not until a few months later that he is forced to reopen the case: David, an eccentric artist and old friend of Matti, has arrived in town for a visit with no knowledge of the death. David has an uneasy feeling about the whole affair, and when he finds Anna Ryd, the town's beautiful English teacher, running away with a bag containing a noose with human hairs on it, he makes it his business to find out what happened.

Educator Wendy Ulmer applies that principle in her jaunty, out-of-the-box alphabet A isn&#39;t for Fox: An Isn&#39;t Alphabet. Running through the alphabet, beginning readers are given a letter and then told what the letter topic isn&#39;t. A isn&#39;t for box; it isn&#39;t for fox. A is for ants that crawl over your socks. Laura Knorr&#39;s colorful, engaging artwork perfectly captures the wit and whimsy behind the alphabet that isn&#39;t what it seems but is so much more!</p><p>A former music and English teacher, Wendy Ulmer was inspired to write Zero, Zilch, Nada because of her own &#34;math phobia&#34; and struggles with math as a child. She also wrote A Isn&#39;t for Fox: An Isn&#39;t Alphabet. Wendy lives in Arrowsic, Maine.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;Alphabet books abound, but playful verse and an inventive concept set this "Isn't Alphabet" apart from more traditional titles. Ulmer tells her listeners what each letter does not stand for before offering a word that begins with the correct sound. "A isn't for box; it isn't for fox/A is for ants that crawl over your socks./B isn't for kite; it isn't for light./B is for bats that fly by in the night." Though the entertaining non-examples show an appreciation for the audience's sense of the silly, Knorr's charming paintings of winking cats, smiling jellyfish, trumpeting lions, and pillow-fighting llamas are worth the purchase price alone. Each letter is presented in upper- and lowercase with an accompanying array of images. Children who are confident in their phonemic prowess will be enticed to identify the appropriate noun pictured with each letter. Artful compositions will invite even younger listeners to linger over each illustration, regardless of the potential lesson. The anthropomorphized images make even the less-familiar creatures in Ulmer's examples ("nuthatch," "Xenops") more accessible. This pleasant work will be at home in most libraries.&#x2014;<i>Jayne Damron, Farmington Community Library, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the sagebrush, desert country of southern valleys of the Okanagan and Similkameen across to the high grandeur of the East Kootenays, the southern interior of BC remains an entrancing region. To some people it is the ghost town country, and area where half a hundred towns stood in another century and names like Sandon, Phoenix, Ferguson and Cascade City were familiar words. To others it is the land of gold creeks, for there was a time when streams like Perry, Granite, Rock and Wild Horse drew thousands of miners in their never ending quest for Eldorado. Fortunately, some of this area remains relatively unchanged and even today the wilderness is but a glance away and beyond the traveled routes, the trail blazing country still beckons. For that rather unique breed, those who feel at ease in places far off the beaten path or deep in the back country where the echoes of history are still audible and the atmosphere of half-forgotten eras lingers on, we hope that this book will be enjoyable, for it is for those individuals that is in intended.</p><p>Neville Langrell (Bill) Barlee (October 15, 1932 &#x2013; June 14, 2012) was a Canadian politician who was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a New Democrat in 1988.

In fact, the door was beyond ordinary, wood and fourpaneled, the kind of door you see standing guard in front of three out of every four suburban homes, with faded paint and a knocker at chest level no one ever used and a faux brass knob.</p><p>But as I walked toward it, a distant streetlight barely illuminating my way, the dark opening yawning like a mouth ready to gobble me whole, the feeling of doom was unshakable. Each step forward took great effort, as if I were walking not along a somewhat crackled walk but through still-wet cement. My body displayed all the classic symptoms of impending menace: Chill down my spine? Check. Hairs standing up on my arms? Yep. Prickle at the base of the neck? Present. Tingle in the scalp? Right there.</p><p>The house was dark, not a single light on. Chynna warned me that would be the case. The dwelling somehow seemed a little too cookie-cutter, a little too nondescript. That bothered me for some reason. This house was also isolated at the tippy end of the cul-de-sac, hunkering down in the darkness as though fending off intruders.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like it.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like anything about this, but this is what I do. When Chynna called I had just finished coaching the inner-city fourth-grade Newark Biddy Basketball team. My team, all kids who, like me, were products of foster care (we call ourselves the NoRents, which is short for No Parents&#x2014;gallows humor), had managed to blow a six-point lead with two minutes left. On the court, as in life, the NoRents aren&#x2019;t great under pressure.</p><p>Chynna called as I was gathering my young hoopsters for my postgame pep talk, which usually consisted of giving my charges some life-altering insight like &#x201c;Good effort,&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get them next time,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget we have a game next Thursday,&#x201d; always ending with &#x201c;Hands in&#x201d; and then we yell, &#x201c;Defense,&#x201d; choosing to chant that word, I suppose, because we play none.</p><p>&#x201c;Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Chynna. Please come.&#x201d;</p><p>Her voice trembled, so I dismissed my team, jumped in my car, and now I was here. I hadn&#x2019;t even had time to shower. The smell of gym sweat mixed now with the smell of fear sweat. I slowed my pace.</p><p>What was wrong with me?</p><p>I probably should have showered, for one thing. I&#x2019;m not good without a shower. Never have been. But Chynna had been adamant. Now, she had begged. Before anyone got home. So here I was, my gray T-shirt darkened with perspiration and clinging to my chest, heading to that door.</p><p>Like most youngsters I work with, Chynna was seriously troubled, and maybe that was what was setting off the warning bells. I hadn&#x2019;t liked her voice on the phone, hadn&#x2019;t really warmed to this whole setup. Taking a deep breath, I glanced behind me. In the distance, I could see some signs of life on this suburban night&#x2014;house lights, a flickering television or maybe computer monitor, an open garage door&#x2014;but in this cul-de-sac, there was nothing, not a sound or movement, just a hush in the dark.</p><p>My cell phone vibrated, nearly making me jump out of my skin. I figured that it was Chynna, but no, it was Jenna, my ex-wife. I hit answer and said, &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I ask a favor?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little busy right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just need someone to babysit tomorrow night. You can bring Shelly if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shelly and I are, uh, having trouble,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Again? But she&#x2019;s great for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have trouble holding on to great women.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna, my lovely ex, has been remarried for eight years. Her new husband is a well-respected surgeon named Noel Wheeler. Noel does volunteer work for me at the teen center. I like Noel and he likes me. He has a daughter by a previous marriage, and he and Jenna have a six-year-old girl named Kari. I&#x2019;m Kari&#x2019;s godfather, and both kids call me Uncle Dan. I&#x2019;m the family go-to babysitter.</p><p>I know this all sounds very civilized and Pollyanna, and I suppose it is. In my case, it could be simply a matter of necessity. I have no one else&#x2014;no parents, no siblings&#x2014;ergo, the closest thing I have to family is my ex-wife. The kids I work with, the ones I advocate for and try to help and defend, are my life, and in the end I&#x2019;m not sure I do the slightest bit of good.</p><p>Jenna said, &#x201c;Earth to Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; I said to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Six thirty. You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna made a smooching noise into the mouthpiece and hung up. I looked at the phone for a moment, remembered our own wedding day. It was a mistake for me to get married. It is a mistake for me to get too close to people, and yet I can&#x2019;t help it. Someone cue the violins so I can wax philosophical about how it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. I don&#x2019;t think that applies to me. It is in humans&#x2019; DNA to repeat the same mistakes, even after we know better. So here I am, the poor orphan who scraped his way up to the top of his class at an elite Ivy League school but never really scraped off who he was. Corny, but I want someone in my life. Alas, that is not my destiny. I am a loner who isn&#x2019;t meant to be alone.</p><p><i>&#x201c;We are evolution&#x2019;s garbage, Dan. . . .&#x201d;</i></p><p>My favorite foster &#x201c;dad&#x201d; taught me that. He was a college professor who loved to get into philosophical debates.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Think about it, Dan. Throughout mankind, the strongest and brightest did what? They fought in wars. That only stopped this past century. Before that, we sent our absolute best to fight on the front lines. So who stayed home and reproduced while our finest died on distant battlefields? The lame, the sick, the weak, the crooked, the cowardly&#x2014;in short, the least of us. That&#x2019;s what we are the genetic by-product of, Dan&#x2014;millenniums of weeding out the premium and keeping the flotsam. That&#x2019;s why we are all garbage&#x2014;the dung from centuries of bad breeding.&#x201d;</i></p><p>I forwent the knocker and rapped on the door lightly with my knuckles. The door creaked open a crack. I hadn&#x2019;t realized that it was ajar.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like that either. A lot I didn&#x2019;t like here.</p><p>As a kid, I watched a lot of horror movies, which was strange because I hated them. I hated things jumping out at me. And I really couldn&#x2019;t stand movie gore. But I would still watch them and revel in the predictably moronic behavior of the heroines, and right now those scenes were replaying in my head, the ones where said moronic heroine knocks on a door and it opens a little and you scream, &#x201c;Run, you scantily clad bimbo!&#x201d; and she wouldn&#x2019;t and you couldn&#x2019;t understand it and two minutes later, the killer would be scooping out her skull and munching on her brain.</p><p>I should go right now.</p><p>In fact, I will. But then I flashed back to Chynna&#x2019;s call, to the words she&#x2019;d said, the trembling in her voice. I sighed, leaned my face toward the opening, peered into the foyer.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Enough with the cloak and dagger.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>My voice echoed. I expected silence. That would be the next step, right? No reply. I slipped the door open a little, took a tentative step forward. . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Dan? I&#x2019;m in the back. Come in.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice was muffled, distant. Again I didn&#x2019;t like this, but there was no way I was backing out now. Backing out had cost me too much throughout my life. My hesitation was gone. I knew what had to be done now.</p><p>I opened the door, stepped inside, and closed the door behind me.</p><p>Others in my position would have brought a gun or some kind of weapon. I had thought about it. But that just doesn&#x2019;t work for me. No time to worry about that now. No one was home. Chynna had told me that. And if they were, well, I would handle that when the moment came.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go to the den, I&#x2019;ll be there in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice sounded . . . off. I saw a light at the end of the hall and moved toward it. There was a noise now. I stopped and listened. Sounded like water running. A shower maybe.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just changing. Out in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>I moved into the low-lit den. I saw one of those dimmer-switch knobs and debated turning it up, but in the end I chose to leave it alone. My eyes adjusted pretty quickly. The room had cheesy wood paneling that looked as if it were made from something far closer to vinyl than anything in the timber family. There were two portraits of sad clowns with huge flowers on their lapels, the kind of painting you might pick up at a particularly tacky motel&#x2019;s garage sale. There was a giant open bottle of no-name vodka on the bar.</p><p>I thought I heard somebody whisper.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d; I called out.</p><p>No answer. I stood, listened for more whispering. Nothing.</p><p>I started toward the back, toward where I heard the shower running.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right out,&#x201d; I heard the voice say. I pulled up, felt a chill. Because now I was closer to the voice. I could hear it better. And here was the thing I found particularly strange about it:</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t sound at all like Chynna.</p><p>Three things tugged at me. One, panic. This wasn&#x2019;t Chynna. Get out of the house. Two, curiosity. If it wasn&#x2019;t Chynna, who the hell was it and what was going on? Three, panic again. It had been Chynna on the phone&#x2014;so what had happened to her?</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t just run out now.</p><p>I took one step toward where I&#x2019;d come in, and that was when it all happened. A spotlight snapped on in my face, blinding me. I stumbled back, hand coming up to my face.</p><p>&#x201c;Dan Mercer?&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. Female voice. Professional. Deep tone. Sounded oddly familiar.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly there were other people in the room. A man with a camera. Another with what looked like a boom mike. And the female with the familiar voice, a stunning woman with chestnut brown hair and a business suit.</p><p>&#x201c;Wendy Tynes, <i>NTC News</i>. Why are you here, Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my mouth, nothing came out. I recognized the woman from that TV newsmagazine . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Why have you been conversing online in a sexual manner with a thirteen-year-old girl, Dan? We have your communications with her.&#x201d;</p><p>. . . the one that sets up and catches pedophiles on camera for all the world to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you here to have sex with a thirteen-year-old girl?&#x201d;</p><p>The truth of what was going on there hit me, freezing my bones. Other people flooded the room. Producers maybe. Another cameraman. Two cops. The cameras came in closer. The lights got brighter. Beads of sweat popped up on my brow. I started to stammer, started to deny.</p><p>But it was over.</p><p>Two days later, the show aired. The world saw.</p><p>And the life of Dan Mercer, just as I somehow knew it would be when I approached that door, was destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>WHEN MARCIA MCWAID FIRST SAW HER daughter&#x2019;s empty bed, panic did not set in. That would come later.</p><p>She had woken up at six AM, early for Saturday morning, feeling pretty terrific. Ted, her husband of twenty years, slept in the bed next to her. He lay on his stomach, his arm around her waist. Ted liked to sleep with a shirt on and no pants. None. Nude from the waist down. &#x201c;Gives my man down there room to roam,&#x201d; he would say with a smirk. And Marcia, imitating her daughters&#x2019; teenage singsong tone, would say, &#x201c;T-M-I&#x201d;&#x2014;Too Much Information.</p><p>Marcia slipped out of his grip and padded down to th...</p></p><h2>Rose for Your Pocket</h2><p>In <i>A Rose for Your Pocket,</i> Thich Nhat Hanh invites children of all ages to reflect on the question: Have you loved your mother enough? This lovely prose poem, a gentle reminder of the qualities embodied by mothers, leads the reader to a new and deeper appreciation of his or her mother, whether she is still alive or has passed away. Nhat Hanh shows how motherhood is celebrated in different cultures and shares the story of how his desire to become a monk affected his relationship with his own mother. Previously available only as a small, staple-bound booklet, this completely redesigned and revised edition contains the original text along with additional material on motherhood based on Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s more recent teachings. It also includes a meditation on the Interbeing&#x201d; of mother and child, teachings on mindfulness and finding one&#x2019;s true home, and instructions for the beautiful Rose Ceremony.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese Buddhist monk. His life long efforts to generate peace and reconciliation moved Martin Luther King, Jr. to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967. He is the founder of Van Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon, and has taught at Columbia University and the Sorbonne. He is the author of Being Peace, The Miracle of Mindfulness, Peace Is Every Step, and 75 other books.</p><h2>Dragons: A Book of Designs (Dover Pictorial Archive)</h2><p>Reptilian in appearance, able to fly, and possessing supernatural powers, dragons were also said to be vigilant guardians of fair maidens, treasures, and villages. The age-old mythical creature, depicted in a wide array of configurations, is featured in this striking collection of original designs. <br>Scores of black-and-white images of the powerful monster &#x2014; all royalty-free &#x2014; are based on motifs from fairy tale collections, medieval French and Celtic manuscripts, Japanese and Chinese artwork, and other rare sources. Depicted are smoke-and-fire-breathing dragons, scaly creatures of the sea, powerful beasts endangering the lives of mariners, Celtic dragons with interwoven body parts, and much more. <br>Ideal for book and magazine illustration, these 118 imaginative representations will also appeal to craftworkers and fans of legendary curiosities. <br></p><p></p><h2>The Rise of Southern Republicans</h2><p><p> The transformation of Southern politics over the past fifty years has been one of the most significant developments in American political life. The emergence of formidable Republican strength in the previously solid Democratic South has generated a novel and highly competitive national battle for control of Congress. Tracing the slow and difficult rise of Republicans in the South over five decades, Earl and Merle Black tell the remarkable story of political upheaval. </p><p> <i>The Rise of Southern Republicans</i> provides a compelling account of growing competitiveness in Southern party politics and elections. Through extraordinary research and analysis, the authors track Southern voters' shifting economic, cultural, and religious loyalties, black/white conflicts and interests during and after federal civil rights intervention, and the struggles and adaptations of congressional candidates and officials. </p><p> A newly competitive South, the authors argue, means a newly competitive and revitalized America. The story of how the South became a two-party region is ultimately the story of two-party politics in America at the end of the twentieth century. Earl and Merle Black have written a bible for anyone who wants to understand regional and national congressional politics over the past half-century. Because the South is now at the epicenter of Republican and Democratic strategies to control Congress, <i>The Rise of Southern Republicans</i> is essential to understanding the dynamics of current American politics. </p></p><p><b>Earl Black</b> is Herbert S. Autrey Professor of Political Science at Rice University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/BLARIS_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Juno and the Paycock (Plays)</h2><p>In his early forties, while continuing to support himself as a laborer, we wrote, in quick succession three realistic plays about the slums of Dublin, known as the Dublin Trilogy.<i> Juno and the Paycock</i>, the second installment of the trilogy, was performed in the Abbey Theatre in 1924&#x2014;the Abbey theatre produced the first installment of the trilogy, <i>The Shadow of a Gunman</i> (not included in this volume) in 1923.<i> Juno and the Paycock </i>deals with the unpleasantness of war and the misery of the victims during the the Irish struggle for indepenence. It was awarded the Hawthornden Prize. <br><br>As his career progressed, O'Casey experiemented with expressionism and symbolism, which resulted in <i>Within the Gates;</i> <i>Red Roses for Me</i>, a semiautobiographical work; and <i>Cock-a-Doodle Dandy</i>. Due to an increase of nationalism during the Civil War and Irish Independence movement, his plays were received well, although, at times, with protest and restriction.<br></p><p><b>Sean O'Casey</b> was born on March 30, 1880 in Dublin, Ireland. His first plays, <i>The Shadow of a Gunman</i>, <i>Juno and the Paycock</i>, and <i>The Plough and the Stars</i>, also known as the Dublin Trilogy, were performed at the Abbey Theatre with great success; these plays are all collected in one volume called <i>The Dublin Trilogy</i>, which is available exculsively from Faber &amp; Faber. His many works include <i>The Star Turned Red</i>, <i>The Silver Tassie</i>, and <i>Purple Dust</i>. He died on September 18, 1964. <br>"From the perspective of the 1990s O'Casey stands out as Ireland's greatest playwright of the century. He it was who most passionately, most powerfully and most memorably dramatized the traumatic birth of the nation. He it was who gave to the twentieth-century theatre a greater range of vivid and original characters, male and female, than any other Irish playwright. O'Casey's language, controversial though it may be in some circles, is a third feature of his work which for its richness, colour and vitality has won for him a lasting place in the international repertory."--Christopher Murray, <i>Twentieth-Century Irish Drama</i> <br><br>"The power of Juno and the Paycock never fails to surprise and enthral and inspire. Its violent passion, its deep humanity, its bubbling humour and its appalling tragedy are soaked in the very spirit of Ireland itself."--<i>Daily Mail</i><br></p><h2>The History of Rockets (Venture Book)</h2><p>Surveys the invention, development, and different uses of rockets, from their beginnings in ancient Greece and China to modern efforts to explore outer space</p><p>Grade 4-6-Fans of loud, dangerous machines will lament only the mediocre illustrations in this wide-angle history of rockets, from the kind launched from soda bottles to the monsters that carried men to the Moon. Miller opens with homespun demonstrations of Isaac Newton's relevant principles, then retraces the chain of experiments, disasters, and refinements that began with Archytas of Tarentum's steam-driven wooden pigeon and culminated in the mighty Saturn 5. In his view, the modern history of rocketry is a grand amalgam of Big Science and backyard tinkering; over 300,000 people worked on the Saturn 5, but some parts for the recently tested, single-stage McDonnell Douglas DC-X were purchased at Kmart. Taking pains to point out how many uses rockets have beyond carrying weapons, Miller brings readers into the present era of active space exploration and space-plane designs that look beyond the shuttle, then closes with both a page of recommended books and two pages of Web sites. Only the drab, black-and-white, sometimes out-of-focus photographs will keep this from zooming off library shelves-and, as books about our exploration of space tend to zero in on payloads rather than the vehicles that carry them, this will fill a gap in most collections.<br><i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bunny Drop, Vol. 3 (Bunny Drop, 3)</h2><p>As an impromptu dad to Rin, his late grandfather&#39;s illegitimate child, Daikichi Kawachi has experienced his share of firsts while caring for his little aunt (?).

Jonathan Safran Foer has called her writing &#x201c;thrilling.&#x201d; Jeanette Winterson has praised her for her &#x201c;style, ideas, and punch.&#x201d; Here, in a novel at once profound, playful, and exhilaratingly inventive, she transfixes us with a portrait of a family unraveled by a mysterious visitor.<br><br>Amber&#x2014;thirtysomething and barefoot&#x2014;shows up at the door of the Norfolk cottage that the Smarts are renting for the summer. She talks her way in. She tells nothing but lies. She stays for dinner.<br><br>Eve Smart, the author of a best-selling series of biographical reconstructions, thinks Amber is a student with whom her husband, Michael, is sleeping. Michael, an English professor, knows only that her car broke down. Daughter Astrid, age twelve, thinks she&#x2019;s her mother&#x2019;s friend. Son Magnus, age seventeen, thinks she&#x2019;s an angel.<br><br>As Amber insinuates herself into the family, the questions of who she is and how she&#x2019;s come to be there drop away. Instead, dazzled by her seeming exoticism, the Smarts begin to examine the accidents of their lives through the searing lens of Amber&#x2019;s perceptions. When Eve finally banishes her from the cottage, Amber disappears from their sight, but not&#x2014;they discover when they return home to London&#x2014;from their profoundly altered lives.<br><br>Fearlessly intelligent and written with an irresistible blend of lyricism and whimsy, <i>The Accidental</i> is a tour de force of literary improvisation that explores the nature of truth, the role of chance, and the transformative power of storytelling.</p><p>Before writing <i>The Accidental</i>, Ali Smith wrote <i>Hotel World</i>, shortlisted for both the Orange Prize and the Man Booker Prize, and several short story collections. Her work is absolutely original, with a trademark quirky style, with whole passages that seem to have been bound into the wrong book and occasional historical asides completely outside the narrative line. Don't be fooled; with Smith, every word has a purpose. <p> Amber is the catalyst who makes the novel happen. She appears on the doorstep of the Smart's rented summer cottage in Norfolk, England, barefoot and unexpected. Eve Smart, a third-rate author suffering writer's block, believes that she is a friend of her husband's. Michael is a womanizing University professor, but he doesn't usually drag his quarry home. He thinks that she must be a friend of Eve's. Everyone is politely confused and Amber is invited to dinner. She is a consummate liar and manipulator who manages to seduce everyone in the family in some significant way. </p><p> Magnus, Eve's 17-year-old son from a former marriage and Astrid, her 12-year-old daughter, are easy prey. Magnus is in despair. He played a prank on a classmate and it went horribly wrong when she killed herself because of the humiliation it caused. He cannot shake the guilt and is about to hang himself from the shower rod when Amber walks into the bathroom, the perfect deus ex machina. She bathes him and takes him back downstairs, announcing that she found him trying to kill himself. Everyone titters. Could it be possible? This is a recurring question as Amber's behavior becomes more and more outrageous. Is this really happening, or is it some family-wide delusion? To add to the mystery, there is a Rashomon-like character to the story in that the same events are recalled by the Smarts through their own filters. </p><p> This is a completely engrossing novel that raises as many questions as it answers. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><b>Ali Smith</b> is the author of six works of fiction, including the novel <i>Hotel World</i>, which was short&#x2013;listed for both the Orange Prize and the Booker Prize in 2001 and won the Encore Award and the Scottish Arts Council Book of the Year Award in 2002.

A contributing editor at <em>Essence</em> magazine, her fiction and nonfiction have appeared in <em>Ms.</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>. She lives in New Jersey.</p>In her adult fiction debut, Essence magazine executive editor Wesley introduces a decisive, independent PI and single mother as heroine but sets her in a transparent, formulaic plot. Tamara Hayle, a divorced ex-cop, and her 14-year-old son, Jamal, live in Newark, N.J., not far from Jamal's father, DeWayne, who has three other sons by three different women. Ordinarily, Tamara has no sympathy for DeWayne, but when one of his sons dies of what the cops say is a drug overdose, she agrees to DeWayne's request that she investigate the young man's apartment. She finds a neat room with fresh food in the fridge and extra money carefully stashed away--not the expected residence of a cocaine addict. When another of DeWayne's sons drowns in a bathtub five days later and another is shot soon after that, Tamara becomes terrified for Jamal's safety. Wesley creates a broad, interesting cast, from gentle Jamal to a suave, violent-tempered Jamaican who tries to seduce Tamara, but too little is revealed of the PI herself. The book's strength lies in its portrayal of black family life in dangerous times--future installments of this promised series will have to fill us in on Tamara.

You would probably despise books--just like the young protagonist in Eric Sanvoisin and illustrator Martin Matje's deliciously bizarre story <i>The Ink Drinker</i>. One summer vacation, while the boy is working in the store and hoping shoplifters will ease his burden, he spots a weird, pale stranger drinking a book. With a straw. As soon as the ink drinker flees (at the sound of the boy's gasp), the young spy locates the customer's book and discovers that it is completely blank except for a letter or two! Like a real detective, he races out of the store on the heels of this tough customer... all the way to the cemetery... all the way into a vaulted monument shaped like an ink bottle... all the way to a pen-shaped casket where the man (or beast?) lies snoring. As the book-vampire's mysteries unfold like a good novel, we are no longer sure whether the boy is awake or asleep, or whether the boy could possibly have fallen prey to the strange fellow's powers. "As I sucked the first words of the second paragraph, the lights were suddenly turned on. Dad was there. I swallowed wrong, and the words got stuck."

Model of Organizing and Advocacy</h2><p><p>Working for Justice, which includes eleven case studies of recent low-wage worker organizing campaigns in Los Angeles, makes the case for a distinctive "L.A. Model" of union and worker center organizing. Networks linking advocates in worker centers and labor unions facilitate mutual learning and synergy and have generated a shared repertoire of economic justice strategies. The organized labor movement in Los Angeles has weathered the effects of deindustrialization and deregulation better than unions in other parts of the United States, and this has helped to anchor the city's wider low-wage worker movement. Los Angeles is also home to the nation's highest concentration of undocumented immigrants, making it especially fertile territory for low-wage worker organizing.</p><p>The case studies in Working for Justice are all based on original field research on organizing campaigns among L.A. day laborers, garment workers, car wash workers, security officers, janitors, taxi drivers, hotel workers as well as the efforts of ethnically focused worker centers and immigrant rights organizations. The authors interviewed key organizers, gained access to primary documents, and conducted participant observation. Working for Justice is a valuable resource for sociologists and other scholars in the interdisciplinary field of labor studies, as well as for advocates and policymakers.</p></p><p>Ruth Milkman is Professor of Sociology at the CUNY Graduate Center and Academic Director of CUNY's Murphy Labor Institute.

Kupchan, <em>New York Times</em></strong></p> In a book that brings a magisterial command of history to the most urgent of contemporary questions, two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., explores the war in Iraq, the presidency, and the future of democracy. Describing unilateralism as "the oldest doctrine in American history," Schlesinger nevertheless warns of the dangers posed by the fatal turn in U.S. policy from deterrence and containment to preventive war. He writes powerfully about George W. Bush's expansion of presidential power, reminding us nevertheless of our country's distinguished legacy of patriotism through dissent in wartime. And in a new chapter written especially for the paperback edition, he examines the historical role of religion in American politics as a background for an assessment of Bush's faith-based presidency.</p><p>Arthur M. Schlesinger (1917 - 2007) was a historian who served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy. Among his many works are the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Age of Jackson and A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House.Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the author of such magisterial works as The Age of Roosevelt, is the doyen of American historians. He is also a fervent liberal, and the two roles -- the intellectual and the partisan -- do not always mesh smoothly. But if we make generous allowance for his politics while paying due respect to his preeminence, this elegant and learned little book (a mere 160 pages in large type) offers a luminous and provocative guide for the perplexed in times of war.<p>The targets of Schlesinger's passion are the Iraq war and the �ber-imperial presidency of George W. Bush. Some arrows hit home; some end up among the trees. One central instance is the chapter on "How to Democratize American Democracy," where Schlesinger complains bitterly about a president who won only a minority of the popular vote dragging the country into a foolish war. But since John Quincy Adams in 1824, minority presidents have been almost as American as apple pie. The sad but strictly constitutional fact is that the states, not the people, elect the president, a system that tends to overrepresent tiny or sparsely populated states. So don't blame W., blame the Founding Fathers.</p><p>Or blame the people, who, in spite of a nasty, inconclusive war in Iraq, have returned Bush to the White House with a nice margin, adding some 9 million votes to his 50.4 million tally in 2000 and letting him carry the popular vote. So the principle of "one person, one vote," which Schlesinger advocates with a vengeance to guard against misbegotten foreign adventures, is a tricky thing; it all depends on what vox populi is saying. Having preached the wisdom of majorities, Schlesinger must be aghast at the outcome of November 2. One wonders whether he would still target George W. Bush today -- or the "false consciousness" of the electorate.</p><p>Still, even those who (like this reviewer) supported the Iraq war now often harbor second thoughts. But foolish foreign ventures also are practically as old as the republic -- beginning with America's second war against Britain, the War of 1812, which almost ended in a humiliating rout when the Brits burned the Capitol and the White House. And it is not so obvious, as Schlesinger avers, that the folly in both 1812 or 2003 was glaringly self-evident ex ante.</p><p>For the "logic" of either war was hardly demented. Heavily dependent on European markets, those young Americans in 1812 rightly railed against the motherland for press-ganging their sailors and choking their trade. The "logic" of the Iraq war was no less plausible: Since the "root cause" of anti-American terrorism was the pathologies of Arab political culture, going for "regime change" and democracy was evidently the right thing to do.</p><p>The real problem, as so often in American history, was neither the "imperial presidency" nor national hubris but the woeful gap between means and ends. In 1812, it was foolhardy to attack the mightiest navy in the world with a handful of creaky ships. In 2003, it was tragically reckless to believe that the United States could just slice through Saddam Hussein's armies, hand over power in Baghdad and go home. Approvingly, Schlesinger quotes President George H.W. Bush's secretary of defense in 1991: "Once you've got Baghdad, it's not clear what you do with it. . . . It's not clear what kind of government you would put in. . . . How much credibility is [that] government going to have if it's set up by the United States military?. . . . To have American military forces engaged in a civil war inside Iraq would fit the definition of quagmire, and we have absolutely no desire to get bogged down in that fashion." The name of that defense secretary, of course, was Dick Cheney.</p><p>A lesser historian would have stuck to the diatribes; Schlesinger, however, resists pat prescriptions. He reminds those who inveigh against Bush-style "unilateralism" that this impulse also is as American as motherhood and the flag: "There is no older American tradition in the conduct of foreign affairs," he rightly notes -- from Thomas Jefferson to William Jefferson Clinton. The common denominator of both isolationism and interventionism is precisely unilateralism, the conviction that America can go it alone -- in 1812 as in 2003.</p><p>Needless to say, Schlesinger does not cherish this reflex. Tracing Sen. John Kerry's "global test" for intervention abroad back to the 18th century, Schlesinger quotes the 63rd Federalist: "In doubtful cases, particularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinions of the impartial world may be the best guide that can be followed." Alas, that guide can be treacherous. Those nations who opposed the Iraq war were hardly "impartial." They followed their own interests, the most urgent of which was to prevent the United States from setting itself up as arbiter over the Middle East.</p><p>Nonetheless, Schlesinger has it right where he transcends passion in favor of prudent principle: "The United States, as it seeks to advance its national interests, will increasingly discover, I believe, that joint action may often be the best way to safeguard those interests." This is not the counsel of wimpishness but of realism. Indifference to consequences was driven by weakness in 1812, by fabulous strength in 2003. In both cases, America might have been better off staying at home rather than going it alone. </p><p>Reviewed by Josef Joffe <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Tommaso asks him to pretend never to have found him. To persuade Will, Tommaso recounts the story of his life and his great love. In the process, he comes to recognise his true role in the events which unfolded, and the legacy of unresolved grief. Now he's being presented with a second chance - but is he ready to pay the price it exacts? THAT SUMMER IN PUGLIA is a tale of love, loss, the perils of self-deception and the power of compassion. Puglia offers an ideal setting: its layers of history are integral to the story, itself an excavation of a man's past; Tommaso's increasingly vivid memories of its sensuous colours, aromas and tastes, and of how it felt to love and be loved, eventually transform the discomforting tone with which he at first tries to keep Will and painful truths at a distance. This remarkable debut combines a gripping plot and perceptive insights into human nature with delicate lyricism.<br><br>"Very beautiful, surprising and evocative."--Simonetta Agnello Hornby<br><br>"This is an enchanting slow burn of a novel; a notable debut. Vescina's voice is admirably clear, her descriptions lucid, and her characters are human to the core."--Rachel Seiffert<br><br>"THAT SUMMER IN PUGLIA is rich in insights into human emotions. It's the tale of the disastrous course even a great love can take if bitterness is allowed to prevail and chances of forgiveness are rejected, but also of the miracles it can work if profoundly experienced and expressed. Valeria Vescina's style has the fluidity of the great European novelists. Her characterisations are at once vivid and poetic, and the plot ever-surprising. Finally, here is the discovery through literature of Puglia, with its remarkable synthesis of Mediterranean history and cultures--and how appropriate, as this is, deep down, Greek tragedy."--Edoardo Winspeare</p><p>Valeria Vescina is from Puglia, was educated in Switzerland and the UK, and has lived for years in London with her family.

The sea shifted in the blackness, more felt than heard.Flickering torches marked the walls and towers of the College of Animists, riding a ridge above the jungles and the sea. On the slowly rising slopes, the thick rustling night marked the forests of the Lemyri. Here and there, the canopy glowed with fireflies, or the lamps of a crownhome. Beyond the College, along the coast, were the brighter and wider lights of Humani dwellings. On the border of Humani and Lemyri lands, a downhill walk from the College, was a sprawl of particularly bright lights, and noise, and music.The tents spread out like skirts around the trunks of the massive trees, to protect the revellers from anything dropped by the Lemyri in the branches above. They also served to concentrate the smoke and smells of the cooking fires, and the noise, and the people. Humani and Lemyri and even a few Rodeni moved from tent to tent, talking, drinking, bartering, shouting. It was Trade-Meet, a festival held to celebratethe many differing species of the Archipelago, and to encourage them to work for their mutual benefit.<i>Right</i>, thought Alex wearily, as he watched a small but spry Lemyri artisan proceed to deliver a thorough and painful beating to a Human who'd been too drunk to avoid crashing into the Lemyr's display of dried fruits. Other Humani came into the fray, and then more Lemyri, and soon a mass brawl of fur and skin and profanity was raging in the ruins of the stall. Meanwhile, a Roden hopped cautiously up and started shoveling the spilled fruits into a sack. Maybe Trade-Meet meant something on other islands, where it was held with religious significance, but here on Highjade it was only a tradition, along with such other traditions as insults, prejudice, and blood feuds. Alex wished he'd stayed at home, at the College."Whaaoo! Party!!" shouted Jocin, right in his ear. She was walking along next to him. On his other side, his other friend, Phyl, laughed as Jocin flung her drinking gourd. It splashed somewhere into the melee, but went unnoticed. All three of them were already very drunk. Alex, being the cause of the other two's celebration, was even more so. Jocin and Phyl had to help him stagger along to the next drinking-tent. Since they were fairly tall, and Alex quite short for a Human, they looked like an unsteady W as they wove through the crowds."T'kren, I think we ought to go back now," Alex managed to protest as he was dragged along. "I've got a lot to do t'morrow ...""Ah bisht you do," snorted Jocin, dragging him into a tent. "Listen to some babble, get your pendant, and then off you go, and we'll never see our favorite takre again.""He's graduating, not being executed," Phyl protested gently, helping Alex to collapse onto a smooth wood bench, while waving a hand at the frazzled Lemyri drinkseller. "He'll come back after his spirit quest, won't you, Alex?""I'll have to," mumbled Alex. He wasn't feeling well.Even though he was sitting down now, the room still seemed to be staggering around him."Even so, he'll never have another chance to get drunk with us, his bestest takren," Jocin insisted. Graduated Animists were forbidden to drink alcohol or, indeed, take intoxicants of any form. Alex felt he'd already had enough for a lifetime. "Takren" meant "siblings" in the Lemyri language; but these three were not related, as a casual glance revealed. All three had their hair cut short, as was the tradition for students, but there the resemblance ended. Phyl was tall and graceful, older than Alex by a decade. Jocin was a year younger than Alex and seemed to bristle with wild energy. Alex himself was barely five feet high, almost frail-looking, with the pale skin (tanned now from Highjade's endless summers) and the dark eyes and hair of a northern clime. He was sixteen, and despite the difference in their ages, he was graduating tomorrow, and his two friends would still have some years to go."Drinking contest!" Jocin shouted, grabbing a ceramic mug and pounding it so hard against their table that it shattered. She threw out a string of polished bone beads in trade-payment. "Run a tab! Drinking contest! Get out the hard stuff, m'tosho tak-takuni! Tik!" she added in slurred and rather rude Lemyri to the proprietor. The Lemyri pinned his ears back angrily, but turned to fill new mugs from the casks."Hard stuff it is, then, pestilent Human," he grumbled in his own language to himself, as he poured.Another Lemyr dropped down from the branches above and landed lightly on their table. Phyl and Jocin drew back warily, even as the smirking proprietor set a tray of mugs on their table, in front of the furry spiderlike toes of the newcomer."Drinking contest, is it?" purred the Lemyr, its golden eyes set in the black foxlike mask of its face, giving it an air of menace. The thick fur was piebald in black and white and brown, and the long, erect furry tail waved like a cat's. TheLemyr was the same size as Alex. Its hands and feet had long, thin fingers, without claws, but a lift of its lip showed the sharp white teeth in a parody of a Humani smile. Most fearsome of all was the thick ruff of fur around its neck and shoulders that indicated it was a female, the dominant and more aggressive gender of the species.She sat on their table, a breach of etiquette asking for trouble, and grabbed one of the mugs while she stared fixedly at them. "Apprentices, by your shorn pelts. Does Kataka know you are here?""Well, furrfu, why should the Head Animist care? We're not from that dumb College, are we, takren?" Jocin lied quickly. Alex and Phyl shook their heads. Alex fell off the bench and had to climb back up."No students allowed to sneak off. 'Specially me," he explained drunkenly, as he clung to the table."Only because you try to run away at least twice a year, takre," Jocin chided him. "Anyway, we're not from there.""I should hope not," rumbled the Lemyr. "To have some of her students involved in a disgraceful drunken incident at Trade-Meet would cause a great dishonor to Kataka.""We're just travelers," put in Phyl."Musicians," suggested Alex."Idiots, is what you are," snorted Jocin, giving them a shove, as she grabbed her mug. "You can drink, too, fuzzbutt," she invited the Lemyr. "Us Humani can outdrink our throwback primate cousins anytime." Alex almost threw up in fear as Jocin thereby likely bought herself an instant death-duel for her insubordination, but the Lemyr seemed more amused than offended and, with no more than a restrained twitch of her tail, raised a mug, and they all drank.Alex was rather thirsty, despite his already drunken state, and the new drink was actually very good, with a fruit-juice tang to it. It couldn't be very strong; he couldn't taste any alcohol in it, and it was much better than the palm wine andfermented coconut milk they had been drinking. He had another taste.The female Lemyr's name turned out to be Hashana, and it turned out that she didn't much like Kataka any more than the three students--erm, travelers--did. Despite their earlier attempts at deception, they found themselves chatting with Hashana like old friends, even telling her about Alex's upcoming graduation."Well, congratulations, then," Hashana said, tipping her mug to him. They'd all been matching each other drink for drink, though Alex, who had been talking less than the other two, noticed blearily that the proprietor seemed to be using a different pitcher to refill the Lemyr's glass. <i>Probably giving her better stuff than this fruit juice</i>, he thought to himself, but since Hashana had offered to pay for the rounds he didn't say anything. He realized he'd had more than enough to drink already, and was glad to be slacking off now. He still felt really drunk, even worse than before, really. It must be sitting down that was doing it."Yeah, not bad for a slave-boy, huh?" Jocin said, punching Alex on the arm and knocking him over again."Jocin!" cried Phyl reproachfully. "Come on, we weren't going to mention that, remember?" Alex climbed back onto the bench, his face in odd shades of white and crimson and green."Aw, blow, I'm sorry," Jocin swore. "Here, have another drink." Alex took it and took a big gulp, to hide from the fixed yellow stare of Hashana."A slave, really? At the College?" she asked, her tail waving. Alex nodded wearily, too drunk to care. Reality seemed to be fading in and out anyway, so it probably didn't matter."Yeah, his parents were so poor they had to sell him," explained Jocin, waving her mug around. "But a talent scout for the College spotted him and bought him. Once he graduates, see, then he'll go on his spirit quest.""And then once I've got my Anim, then I come back here," Alex added, bunking one finger on the tabletop for emphasis. "Here. Finish my training.""And then he'll get bought," Phyl said, giving Alex a chummy pat on the back that made him bang his head on the table."Hired!" protested Alex from face-down on the table."Hired, right, to pay off his slave-debt ...""Lemyri do not keep slaves," Hashana said coolly. "I am surprised that Kataka allows it.""Shhh! It'sa sssseeecret," Jocin hissed, winking broadly. "He's the only one. My father paid my way in.""Mine, too," added Phyl."What do you think about it, boy?" Hashana asked, her thin furry fingers gripping the short wool of Alex's hair and lifting his head off the table so she could look at him. "What is it like, to be bought and sold so?""Don' like it," Alex grumbled. "All this time and I'm a thing. Six years of shit and work and sweat and lessons and getting bit by things, and at the end of it all I'm still a ... a thing.""You're a thing worth a lot more now, though," Phyl pointed out to him."Not so much," Alex argued, finishing his drink and attempting to get to his feet. "Look at me. Short. Scrawny. Human. I'd have to bond a fanglion or something to get any respect. Ha!" he shouted, and passed out, falling over backwards into a party of Lemyri, who did not take his intrusion kindly. Jocin and Phyl attempted to pull him out and found themselves embroiled in a screaming brawl, in which the rest of the bar quickly joined, except for Hashana, who retreated quietly back up into the rafters, and Alex, who regained enough consciousness to crawl away blindly.Something was very wrong, he realized dimly. Obviously the fruit juice he'd been sucking down was indeed alcoholic, and very much so. He couldn't walk, could only crawl. Hefumbled through the tent fabric, and out into the mud and loam. People of all races stumbled over him, swore, kicked him, and he fell, and rolled, and threw up. It didn't seem to help. He kept crawling, but everything was dark.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"You gave tilka to <i>Humani?</i>" Kintoku asked incredulously. The Lemyri Animist had been summoned from the College when Jocin and Phyl had at last been pulled from the brawl by the Lemyri police. Both were unconscious and breathing hard."They asked for strong drink," shrugged the proprietor. "It was the strongest I had.""Were there any others? I know these two. There would have been another.""Another, a male I think. Small. I do not see it now," the proprietor replied.Kintoku swore. "Alex. Curse you, if you've cost us ..." He pulled a leathery bundle from the fur of his back, and it unfurled itself into a small fruit bat. The other Lemyri drew back, muttering and flattening their ears against this display of the Animist's power. The Animists were the only type of magic the Lemyri would tolerate, but they still remained wary.Kintoku exchanged a glance with his Anim, stroking the soft fur with a fingertip, and the bat chirped softly in response. "Miska, go, find Alex." He sighed. "Again." The bat launched itself with a flapping storm of wings, barely clearing the door opening.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was all a blur for Alex; crawling through something stinking and then falling down a gully. He had suddenly realized he was alone, and for a moment then, free. Even through his drunken sickness the feeling was intoxicating. He thought he could hear the sea; if he could find the shore, maybe he couldfind a boat, maybe he could find his way away, off the island, away. The thought that tomorrow he would have been allowed to leave anyway didn't stop him.He'd run away before, as Phyl had said. It was futile, always futile. The Animists could always find him--with their Anims, animals of all species that could run faster and see farther and track him by smell and sound. And the people of the College would come and collect him, trying to be understanding but never quite managing. The Humani seemed to think he was ungrateful, that since they'd given him shelter and food and education and care, he had no right even to want to escape. He'd never been any more harshly dealt with than any other student. And yet he wasn't free.He made it to the beach this time, before the chittering squeal of a bat sounded overhead, and furry shadows materialized out of the palm trees. As Kintoku stepped up, eyes almost glowing with anger, Alex managed to throw up over him and then passed out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The sky was growing lighter, and with it came the noise. Usually the singing tree-apes started it, with short hoots that peaked rapidly into high-low screams of such volume that they carried for miles and effectively woke up everything else. The great cats would break in, with great hollow, sawing roars in round chorus, and the hyenas would begin to whoop. The canines began then, as though in protest at the noise, barking, yapping, yowling, with the wolves howling low and deep below it all. Shrill whistling came from the mustelid pens, and roaring barks from the pinniped colony down on the beach below. The cockerels in the feeder pens crowed loudly and repeatedly, and the striches gave their hissing honks, and the native parrots either imitated one of the other beasts or else did their own free-form raucous screaming. Some of the hoof stock gave belches or bleats or barks or brays or bellows in general contribution, while myriadsmaller creatures stayed silent through the cacophony, in response to their secretive instincts. Finally, as the sun at last broke over the horizon, burning gold over the sea, the College's Lemyri population gave their eerie, structured chorus of chattering ululation in ritual salute to the dawn.Alex moaned and tried to wrap a pillow around his head to shut out the sound. It didn't work. It hadn't worked in all of six years, but the fact that today he might have actually slept in--at long, long last--made him try. The hangover wasn't too bad, at least; the College's allopathist had forced him to down a lot of purging draughts, in preparation for today.His two roommates had already abandoned their hammocks and were shrugging into clothes with the sleepwalking air of long practice. Phyl, also wincing from his hangover, had a black eye. The other roommate, Mikel, grabbed hold of Alex's hammock rope and started swinging it back and forth. (Jocin, of course, was in the girl's dormitory ... unless she'd already sneaked out again on some other mischief.)Mikel swung the hammock harder and harder. It would have made Alex throw up again, if he'd anything left to do it with."Aaaalex, get uuuu...</p><h2>Three Restoration Comedies Etherege: The Man of Mode/Wycherley/the Country Wife/Congreve/Love for Love</h2><p>After the restoration of King Charles II to the British throne in 1660, dramatists experienced new freedom in an age that broke from the strict morality of puritan rule and in which elegance and wit became the chief virtues. Irreverent, licentious and cynical, the three plays collected here hold up a mirror to this dazzling era and satirize the gulf between appearances and reality. In Etherege&#39;s &#34;The Man of Mode&#34; (1676), the womanizing Dorimant meets his match when he falls in love with the unpretentious Harriet, while Wycherley&#39;s &#34;The Country Wife&#34; (c. 1675) depicts the rakish Horner who fakes impotence to fool trusting husbands into giving him easy access to their wives. And in Congreve&#39;s &#34;Love for Love&#34; (1695), the extravagant Valentine can only win his beloved Angelica if he loses his inheritance.</p><p>George Etherege (1636-1689) invented the comedy of intrigue, and led the way for the masterpieces of Congreve and Sheridan. William Wycherley (1640?-1716) is famous for his brilliant wit and savagely clever satire which give him a prominent place in the history of English Restoration drama. William Congreve (1670-1729) was apprenticed under the tutelage of John Dryden. Congreve&#39;s wit and his characters&#39; sexual freedom and experimentation were at odds with the thinking of certain moralists of the day. However, he has since been considered one of the most intellectually accomplished of English playwrights. Gamini Salgado was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and came to England in 1947 to attend the University of Nottingham. He became an expert on Elizabethan and Jacobean literature, and was appointed to the Chair of English at Exeter University in 1977. He died in 1985.</p><h2>Home Grown Stories &amp; Home Fried Lies</h2><p>Home Grown Stories &amp; Home Fried Lies is a delightful look at the colorful life of Mitch Jayne and his time spent in - and out - of the Ozarks. <p>From teaching in one-room schools to the Hollywood big time with the Dillards, from small-town radio DJ to TV star on The Andy Griffith Show, from hound man and hunter to lecturer and author, Mitch has done it this time with a book that will have you laughing, crying, muttering to yourself and running down the street to share stories with your best friend.

An ancient land. Most think they know its history. But few suspect and fewer still know the truth. <br><br>For back in the mists of time came Brutus, last of the Trojan kings, who was armed with the knowledge of how to construct a magical Labyrinth that could rival the might of the gods. He was drawn to this place by the alluring sorceress Genvissa and together they almost succeeded in creating the Labyrinth. But in the end they were thwarted by Brutus's wife Cornelia, who understood the danger to the land. Her actions however trapped them all into a endless cycle of death and rebirth until the magic of the Labyrinth is completed. <br><br>Ages pass. Time and again the players have come close to victory but each time there is a new wrinkle to stay the fulfillment of power.<br><br>The Now that these soul travelers arrive is a most unique one. The English are at war, not with a foreign power but amongst themselves; a mighty Civil War that threatens to destroy a nation. A great pestilence is upon the land and the newly restored Charles II sits upon the throne trying to hold chaos at bay...and he is one of the major players in this drama.<br><br>And he is not alone.<br></p><p>Sara Douglass was born in Penola, a small farming settlement in the south of Australia, in 1957. She spent her early years chasing (and being chased by) sheep and collecting snakes before her parents transported her to the city of Adelaideand the more genteel surroundings of Methodist Ladies College. Having graduated, Sara then became a nurse on her parents' urging (it was both feminine and genteel) and spent seventeen years planning and then effecting her escape.<br><br>That escape came in the form of a Ph.D. in early modern English history. Sara and nursing finally parted company after a lengthy time of bare tolerance, and she took up a position as senior lecturer in medieval European history at the Bendigo campus of the Victorian University of La Trobe. Finding the departmental politics of academic life as intolerable as the emotional rigours of nursing, Sara needed to find another escape.<br><br>This took the form of one of Sara's childhood loves - books and writing. Spending some years practising writing novels, HarperCollins Australia picked up one of Sara's novels, <i>BattleAxe</i> (published in North America as <i>The Wayfarer Redemption</i>), the first in the Tencendor series, and chose it as the lead book in their new fantasy line with immediate success. Since 1995 Sara has become Australia's leading fantasy author and one of its top novelists. Her books are now sold around the world.<br>The prolix third book in Australian author Douglass's Troy Game historical fantasy saga (after 2004's <i>God's Concubine</i>) exhibits the same powerful imagination as its predecessors, but is not the place to start for newcomers. Brutus, legendary king of Troy, is now incarnate in 17th-century England as one of Charles II's companions, while Charles himself is the Stagking from Celtic folklore. Cornelia, Brutus's wife and a moderating influence, is now a young woman named Noah, while the sorceress Genvissa is now Kate, a prostitute and sex slave to Weyland Orr, the reborn Asterion (the original Minotaur). Asterion's sister, Ariadne, reappears as sharp-tongued as ever, revealing that the Labyrinth is now in the parallel universe of Faerie, while the Troy Game itself is incarnate, and still dangerous, in Noah's daughter, Catling. The stakes rise further when the Game sows plague in England, against which Charles has to unleash the Great Fire of London. Though enriched by the author's historical and folkloric expertise, the somewhat jumbled narrative with its many characters, their shifting alliances and frequently unsympathetic sexual encounters may weary even established fans. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why did the public memory of Nazi anti-Jewish persecution and the Holocaust emerge, if selectively, in West Germany, yet was repressed and marginalized in "anti-fascist" East Germany? And how do the politics of left and right come into play in this divided memory? The answers reveal the surprising relationship between how the crimes of Nazism were publicly recalled and how East and West Germany separately evolved a Communist dictatorship and a liberal democracy. This book, for the first time, points to the impact of the Cold War confrontation in both West and East Germany on the public memory of anti-Jewish persecution and the Holocaust. </p><p> Konrad Adenauer, Theodor Heuss, Kurt Schumacher, Willy Brandt, Richard von Weizsacker, and Helmut Kohl in the West and Walter Ulbricht, Wilhelm Pieck, Otto Grotewohl, Paul Merker, and Erich Honnecker in the East are among the many national figures whose private and public papers and statements Herf examines. His work makes the German memory of Nazism--suppressed on the one hand and selective on the other, from Nuremberg to Bitburg--comprehensible within the historical context of the ideologies and experiences of pre-1945 German and European history as well as within the international context of shifting alliances from World War II to the Cold War. Drawing on West German and recently opened East German archives, this book is a significant contribution to the history of belief that shaped public memory of Germany's recent past. </p></p><p>Cowinner of the Fraenkel Prize in Contemporary History of the Wiener Library, LondonA divided Germany occupied the front line of the Cold War, with the result that politicians had an opening to manipulate the Nazi past to serve new purposes. In both Germanys, in different ways, such manipulation distorted the memory of Nazism and impeded natural justice. In his valuable new book, Divided Memory, Jeffrey Herf describes the causes and effects of this depressing outcome ... Germans themselves have had to decide exactly what the response to Nazism ought to be. As Herf shows, they too often set about it expediently and evasively.-David Pryce-Jones, Wall Street Journal</p><h2>The Cassandra Sanction (Ben Hope)</h2><p><p>The master bestseller is back with the most thrilling, shocking and UTTERLY COMPELLING Ben Hope adventure yet!</p><p>Ben Hope is one of the most celebrated action adventure heroes ever and Scott Mariani is one of the most successful home grown thriller writers of all time.

Joe's world is the half-world of drugs and addicts -- the world of furtive fixes in sordid Harlem apartments, of police pursuits down deserted subway stations. Junk for Necchi, however, is a tool, freely chosen and fully justified; he is Cain, the malcontent, the profligate, the rebel who lives by no one's rules but his own. Like DeQuincey and Baudelaire before him, Trocchi's muse was drugs. But unlike his literary predecessors, in his roman a clef, Trocchi never romanticizes the source of his inspiration.

The animals arrive in due time, kicking off blithe happenings that grow out of the hosts&#39; ideas for making the company feel at home and the guests&#39; generous reciprocation of favors. The mountains order refrigerators full of food, decks of playing cards, records for dancing and (of course) a record player, and other things the animals delight in.

Hardy undertakes to investigate in association with Hank Bachelor, his former associate who now runs his own agency. It turns out that McKinley had discovered a way to tap into the massive Sydney basin acquifer, a possible solution to the city's water problems. Working with Margaret who visits Sydney, Bachelor, and his daughter, Megan, Hardy confronts an old enemy and contending forces bent on exploiting the discovery and prepared to kill for it.

But he wasn&#x2019;t counting on a heart attack followed by quadruple-bypass surgery. On the mend in an American hospital, he meets Margaret, an Australian nurse whose father, a noted geologist, has disappeared back home. So Cliff returns to Australia, where he teams up with his daughter, Megan, to find the missing man. He also finds that his growing attraction to Margaret restores some of the balance to his life. Corris, who began publishing the Cliff Hardy novels 30 years ago, did a smart thing awhile back when he took away his protagonist&#x2019;s livelihood, shaking things up considerably. It&#x2019;s interesting to watch the author playing with his character, showing how Cliff attempts to pull himself out of his professional and personal hole.

Of all the tantalizing treats, nothing has stuck around like Marshmallow Fluff. Since that time, the small, family-run company Durkee-Mower has churned out a century of Fluff with the secretive air of Willy Wonka. Little has been made of this extraordinary legacy&#x2015;until now.To author Mimi Graney, Fluff is more than a retro ingredient. It is a story about the merits and pitfalls of adaptation and innovation. Graney deftly brings the factory floor alive, weaving a fascinating narrative about New England's forgotten candy industry, changing social roles for women, the advent of commercial radio and modern advertising, and the supermarket revolution. Fluff has survived two world wars, corporate attacks, nutrition battles, and the rise and fall of manufacturing towns. The world has changed around it, yet this icon remains the same.</p><p></p><h2>Angels Flight</h2><p>An activist attorney is killed in a cute little L.A. trolley called Angels Flight, far from Harry Bosch&#39;s Hollywood turf. But the case is so explosive--and the dead man&#39;s enemies inside the L.A.P.D. are so numerous--that it falls to Harry to solve it. Now the streets are superheating. Harry&#39;s year-old Vegas marriage is unraveling. And the hunt for a killer is leading Harry to another high-profile L.A. murder case, one where every cop had a motive. The question is, did any have the guts?</p><p>Michael Connelly, whose novel <i>The Poet</i> won the 1997 Anthony Award for Best Mystery, is already recognized as one of the smartest and most vivid scribes of the hard-boiled police procedural. Now, with his much-anticipated sixth Harry Bosch novel, <i>Angels Flight</i>, Connelly offers one of the finest pieces of mystery writing to appear in 1998. Bosch is awakened in the middle of the night and, out of rotation, he is assigned to the murder investigation of the high-profile African American attorney Howard Elias. When Bosch arrives at the scene, it seems that almost the entire LAPD is present, including the IAD (the Internal Affairs Division). Elias, who made a career out of suing the police, was sadistically gunned down on the Angels Flight tram just as he was beginning a case that would have struck the core of the department; not surprisingly, L.A.'s men and women in blue become the center of the investigation. Haunted by the ghost of the L.A. riots, plagued by incessant media attention, and facing turmoil at home, Bosch suddenly finds himself questioning friends and associates while working side by side with some longtime enemies. <p> <i>Angels Flight</i> is a detective's nightmare scenario and is disturbingly relevant to the racially tense last decade of the 20th century. Amidst the twists and turns of his complex narrative, Connelly affirms his rightful place among the masters of contemporary mystery fiction. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and author of the bestselling series of Harry Bosch novels and the bestselling novels Chasing the Dime, The Poet, Blood Work, and Void Moon.

This last isn&#x2019;t something I actually saw, but what you end up remembering isn&#x2019;t always the same as what you have witnessed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We live in time &#x2013; it holds us and moulds us &#x2013; but I&#x2019;ve never felt I understood it very well. And I&#x2019;m not referring to theories about how it bends and doubles back, or may exist elsewhere in parallel versions. No, I mean ordinary, everyday time, which clocks and watches assure us passes regularly: tick-tock, click-clock. Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time&#x2019;s malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missing &#x2013; until the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return.&nbsp;<br><br>* * *&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m not very interested in my schooldays, and don&#x2019;t feel any nostalgia for them. But school is where it all began, so I need to return briefly to a few incidents that have grown into anecdotes, to some approximate memories which time has deformed into certainty. If I can&#x2019;t be sure of the actual events any more, I can at least be true to the impressions those facts left. That&#x2019;s the best I can manage.&nbsp;<br><br>There were three of us, and he now made the fourth. We hadn&#x2019;t expected to add to our tight number: cliques and pairings had happened long before, and we were already beginning to imagine our escape from school into life. His name was Adrian Finn, a tall, shy boy who initially kept his eyes down and his mind to himself. For the first day or two, we took little notice of him: at our school there was no welcoming ceremony, let alone its opposite, the punitive induction. We just registered his presence and waited.&nbsp;<br><br>The masters were more interested in him than we were. They had to work out his intelligence and sense of discipline, calculate how well he&#x2019;d previously been taught, and if he might prove &#x2018;scholarship material&#x2019;. On the third morning of that autumn term, we had a history class with Old Joe Hunt, wryly affable in his three-piece suit, a teacher whose system of control depended on maintaining sufficient but not excessive boredom.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Now, you&#x2019;ll remember that I asked you to do some preliminary reading about the reign of Henry VIII.&#x2019; Colin, Alex and I squinted at one another, hoping that the ques�tion wouldn&#x2019;t be flicked, like an angler&#x2019;s fly, to land on one of our heads. &#x2018;Who might like to offer a characterisation of the age?&#x2019; He drew his own conclusion from our averted eyes. &#x2018;Well, Marshall, perhaps. How would you describe Henry VIII&#x2019;s reign?&#x201d;<br><br>Our relief was greater than our curiosity, because Marshall was a cautious know-nothing who lacked the inventiveness of true ignorance. He searched for possible hidden complexities in the question before eventually locating a response.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;There was unrest, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>An outbreak of barely controlled smirking; Hunt himself almost smiled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Would you, perhaps, care to elaborate?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Marshall nodded slow assent, thought a little longer, and decided it was no time for caution. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d say there was great unrest, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Finn, then. Are you up in this period?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>The new boy was sitting a row ahead and to my left. He had shown no evident reaction to Marshall&#x2019;s idiocies.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Not really, sir, I&#x2019;m afraid. But there is one line of thought according to which all you can truly say of any historical event &#x2013; even the outbreak of the First World War, for example &#x2013; is that &#x201c;something happened&#x201d;.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Is there, indeed? Well, that would put me out of a job, wouldn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; After some sycophantic laughter, Old Joe Hunt pardoned our holiday idleness and filled us in on the polygamous royal butcher.&nbsp;<br><br>At the next break, I sought out Finn.&#x2018;I&#x2019;m Tony Webster.&#x2019; He looked at me warily. &#x2018;Great line to Hunt.&#x2019; He seemed not to know what I was referring to. &#x2018;About something happening.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh. Yes. I was rather disappointed he didn&#x2019;t take it up.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t what he was supposed to say.&nbsp;<br><br>Another detail I remember: the three of us, as a symbol of our bond, used to wear our watches with the face on the inside of the wrist. It was an affectation, of course, but perhaps something more. It made time feel like a personal, even a secret, thing.We expected Adrian to note the gesture, and follow suit; but he didn&#x2019;t.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Later that day &#x2013; or perhaps another day &#x2013; we had a double English period with Phil Dixon, a young master just down from Cambridge. He liked to use contemporary texts, and would throw out sudden challenges.&#x2018;&#x201c;Birth, and Copulation, and Death&#x201d; &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what T. S. Eliot says it&#x2019;s all about. Any comments?&#x2019; He once compared a Shakespearean hero to Kirk Douglas in&nbsp;<i>Spartacus</i>. And I remember how, when we were discussing Ted Hughes&#x2019;s poetry, he put his head at a donnish slant and murmured,&#x2018;Of course, we&#x2019;re all wondering what will happen when he runs out of animals.&#x2019; Sometimes, he addressed us as &#x2018;Gentlemen&#x2019;. Naturally, we adored him.&nbsp;<br><br>That afternoon, he handed out a poem with no title, date or author&#x2019;s name, gave us ten minutes to study it, then asked for our responses.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Shall we start with you, Finn? Put simply, what would you say this poem is&nbsp;<i>about</i>?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Adrian looked up from his desk. &#x2018;Eros and Thanatos, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Hmm. Go on.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Sex and death,&#x2019; Finn continued, as if it might not just be the thickies in the back row who didn&#x2019;t understand Greek. &#x2018;Or love and death, if you prefer.The erotic principle, in any case, coming into conflict with the death principle. And what ensues from that conflict. Sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>I was probably looking more impressed than Dixon thought healthy.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Webster, enlighten us further.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I just thought it was a poem about a barn owl, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>This was one of the differences between the three of us and our new friend. We were essentially taking the piss, except when we were serious. He was essentially serious, except when he was taking the piss. It took us a while to work this out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Adrian allowed himself to be absorbed into our group, without acknowledging that it was something he sought. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t. Nor did he alter his views to accord with ours. At morning prayers he could be heard joining in the responses while Alex and I merely mimed the words, and Colin preferred the satirical ploy of the pseudo-zealot&#x2019;s enthusiastic bellow.The three of us considered school sports a crypto-fascist plan for repressing our sex-drive; Adrian joined the fencing club and did the high jump. We were belligerently tone-deaf; he came to school with his clarinet. When Colin denounced the family, I mocked the political system, and Alex made philosophical objections to the perceived nature of reality, Adrian kept his counsel &#x2013; at first, anyway. He gave the impression that he believed in things. We did too &#x2013; it was just that we wanted to believe in our own things, rather than what had been decided for us. Hence what we thought of as our cleansing scepticism.&nbsp;<br><br>The school was in central London, and each day we travelled up to it from our separate boroughs, passing from one system of control to another. Back then, things were plainer: less money, no electronic devices, little fashion tyranny, no girlfriends. There was nothing to distract us from our human and filial duty which was to study, pass exams, use those qualifications to find a job, and then put together a way of life unthreateningly fuller than that of our parents, who would approve, while privately comparing it to their own earlier lives, which had been simpler, and therefore superior. None of this, of course, was ever stated: the genteel social Darwinism of the English middle classes always remained implicit.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Fucking bastards, parents,&#x2019; Colin complained one Monday lunchtime. &#x2018;You think they&#x2019;re OK when you&#x2019;re little, then you realise they&#x2019;re just like . . .&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Henry VIII, Col?&#x2019; Adrian suggested.We were beginning to get used to his sense of irony; also to the fact that it might be turned against us as well.When teasing, or calling us to seriousness, he would address me as Anthony; Alex would become Alexander, and the unlengthenable Colin shortened to Col.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t mind if my dad had half a dozen wives.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And was incredibly rich.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And painted by Holbein.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And told the Pope to sod off.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Any particular reason why they&#x2019;re FBs?&#x2019; Alex asked Colin.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I wanted us to go to the funfair. They said they had to spend the weekedn gardening.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term &#x2018;single�parent family&#x2019; came into use; back then it was &#x2018;a broken home&#x2019;, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn&#x2019;t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family &#x2013; or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In those days, we imagined ourselves as being kept in some kind of holding pen, waiting to he released into our lives. And when that moment came, our lives &#x2013; and time itself &#x2013; would speed up. How were we to know that our lives had in any case begun, that some advantage had already been gained, some damage already inflicted? Also, that our release would only be into a larger holding pen, whose boundaries would be at first undiscernible.&nbsp;<br><br>In the meantime, we were book-hungry, sex-hungry, meritocratic, anarchistic. All political and social systems appeared to us corrupt, yet we declined to consider an alternative other than hedonistic chaos. Adrian, however, pushed us to believe in the application of thought to life, in the notion that principles should guide actions. Previously, Alex had been regarded as the philosopher among us. He had read stuff the other two hadn&#x2019;t, and might, for instance, suddenly declare, &#x2018;Whereof we cannot speak, thereof must we remain silent.&#x2019; Colin and I would consider this idea in silence for a while, then grin and carry on talking. But now Adrian&#x2019;s arrival dislodged Alex from his position &#x2013; or rather, gave us another choice of philosopher. If Alex had read Russell and Wittgenstein, Adrian had read Camus and Nietzsche. I had read George Orwell and Aldous Huxley; Colin had read Baudelaire and Dostoevsky. This is only a slight caricature.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, of course we were pretentious &#x2013; what else is youth for? We used terms like &#x2018;<i>Weltanschauung</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>Sturm und Drang</i>&#x2019;, enjoyed saying &#x2018;That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident&#x2019;, and assured one another that the imagination&#x2019;s first duty was to be transgressive. Our parents saw things differently, picturing their children as innocents suddenly exposed to noxious influence. So Colin&#x2019;s mother referred to me as his &#x2018;dark angel&#x2019;; my father blamed Alex when he found me reading&nbsp;<i>The Communist Manifesto</i>; Colin was fingered by Alex&#x2019;s parents when they caught him with a hard-boiled American crime novel. And so on. It was the same with sex. Our parents thought we might be corrupted by one another into becoming whatever it was they most feared: an incorrigible masturbator, a winsome homosexual, a recklessly impregnatory libertine. On our behalf they dreaded the closeness of adolescent friendship, the predatory behaviour of strangers on trains, the lure of the wrong kind of girl. How far their anxieties outran our experience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>One afternoon Old Joe Hunt, as if picking up Adrian&#x2019;s earlier challenge, asked us to debate the origins of the First World War: specifically, the responsibility of Archduke Franz Ferdinand&#x2019;s assassin for starting the whole thing off. Back then, we were most of us absolutists. We liked Yes v No, Praise v Blame, Guilt v Innocence &#x2013; or, in Marshall&#x2019;s case, Unrest v Great Unrest. We liked a game that ended in a win and loss, not a draw. And so for some, the Serbian gunman, whose name is long gone from my memory, had one hundred per cent individual responsibility: take him out of the equation, and the war would never have happened. Others preferred the one hundred per cent responsibility of historical forces, which had placed the antagonistic nations on an inevitable collision course: &#x2018;Europe was a powder keg waiting to blow&#x2019;, and so on. The more anarchic, like Colin, argued that everything was down to chance, that the world existed in a state of perpetual chaos, and only some primitive storytelling instinct, itself doubtless a hangover from religion, retrospectively imposed meaning on what might or might not have happened.&nbsp;<br><br>Hunt gave a brief nod to Colin&#x2019;s attempt to undermine everything, as if morbid disbelief was a natural by-product of adolescence, something to be grown out of. Masters and parents used to remind us irritatingly that they too had once been young, and so could speak with authority. It&#x2019;s just a phase, they would insist. You&#x2019;ll grow out of it; life will teach you reality and realism. But back then we declined to acknowledge that they had ever been anything like us, and we knew that we grasped life &#x2013; and truth, and morality, and art &#x2013; far more clearly than our compromised elders.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Finn, you&#x2019;ve been quiet. You started this ball rolling. You are, as it were our Serbian gunman.&#x2019; Hunt paused to let the allusion take effect. &#x2018;Would you care to give us the benefit of your thoughts?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, sir.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;What don&#x2019;t you know?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, in one sense. I can&#x2019;t know what it is that I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident.&#x2019; He left one of those slight pauses in which we again wondered if he was engaged in subtle mockery or a high seriousness beyond the rest of us.&#x2018;Indeed, isn&#x2019;t the whole business of ascribing responsibility a kind of cop-out? We want to blame an individual so that everyone else is exculpated. Or we blame a historical process as a way of exonerating individuals. Or it&#x2019;s all anarchic chaos, with the same consequence. It seems to me that there is &#x2013; was &#x2013; a chain of individual respon�sibilities, all of which were necessary, but not so long a chain that everybody can simply blame everyone else. But of course, my desire to ascribe responsibility might be more a reflection of my own cast of mind than a fair analysis of what happ...</p><h2>The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin with CD</h2><p><b>It's hip to be square-and that's why <i>The Legend of Spookley</i> has sold more than 100,000 copies so far!

This book revisits the Sixties we forgot or somehow failed to witness. In a kaleidoscopic global tour of the decade, Gerard DeGroot reminds us that the &#x201c;Ballad of the Green Beret&#x201d; outsold &#x201c;Give Peace a Chance,&#x201d; that the Students for a Democratic Society were outnumbered by Young Americans for Freedom, that revolution was always a pipe dream, and that the Sixties belong to Reagan and de Gaulle more than to Kennedy and Dubcek. </p><p><i>The Sixties Unplugged</i> shows how opportunity was squandered, and why nostalgia for the decade has obscured sordidness and futility. DeGroot returns us to a time in which idealism, tolerance, and creativity gave way to cynicism, chauvinism, and materialism. He presents the Sixties as a drama acted out on stages around the world, a theater of the absurd in which China&#x2019;s Cultural Revolution proved to be the worst atrocity of the twentieth century, the Six-Day War a disaster for every nation in the Middle East, and a million slaughtered Indonesians martyrs to greed.</p><p><i>The Sixties Unplugged</i> restores to an era the prevalent disorder and inconvenient truths that longing, wistfulness, and distance have obscured. In an impressionistic journey through a tumultuous decade, DeGroot offers an object lesson in the distortions nostalgia can create as it strives to impose order on memory and value on mayhem.</p></p><p>Gerard J. DeGroot is Professor of Modern History at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. His many books include <i>The First World War</i> and <i>A Noble Cause?: America and the Vietnam War</i>.&#x201c;Without sentiment or tears, <i>The Sixties Unplugged</i> takes a fresh look at that insane and wonderful sore-thumb decade of the 20th Century.

One might disagree, but DeGroot's book comprises a fascinating revisionist polemic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;DeGroot seeks to debunk the popular legend of the Sixties as a golden age of peace, love and understanding...He has written a book containing a little something to offend--and enlighten--just about everyone...DeGroot's <i>The Sixties Unplugged</i> stands as an informative, well-researched, mostly on-the-mark response to the claims of graying Baby Boomers about the wall-to-wall wonderfulness of that long, strange trip of a decade.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James E. Person Jr.</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In his meaty, rich text, DeGroot argues that the real spirit of the '60s has been lost in a deluge of nostalgia. The "free" decade, the freak show, was one in which China's Cultural Revolution proved to be one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century. The sixties, he argues, were shaped more by the election of Reagan as the governor of California than by Kennedy. We've "chosen" to forget about Sharpeville, the Gaza Strip and Jakarta. The so-called "revolution" of the sixties, as we know it, didn't really exist. History, he argues, is not necessarily an accurate representation of what happened--but the way we view that it happened. His book, disguised as a coffee table "light read," is sure to spark controversy. It is, in effect a history book. Only in it, DeGroot says what few history books have the guts to.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Caitlin O'Toole</b><b>, </b><b><i>Parade</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Sixties Unplugged</i> is a bracing blast for those who want their history unadulterated and straight up.

But the author also includes less familiar stops on the Magical Mystery Tour, reminding readers that the Sixties with a capital S did not belong to America alone. DeGroot's disparate vignettes are grouped into 15 chapters that show that the unrest reached far beyond our coasts, washing onto the shores of Mexico, Britain, Indonesia, Israel, France, China and indeed everywhere that people carried placards or transistor radios.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For many years, the two standard histories of the 1960s in the United States have been Todd Gitlin's <i>The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage</i> and Milton Viorst's <i>Fire in the Streets: America in the 1960s</i>.

She fostered the culture of the Enlightenment and greatly expanded the immense empire created by Czar Ivan the Terrible, shifting the balance of power in Europe eastward. Famous for her will to power and for her dozen lovers, Catherine was also a prolific and gifted writer. <br><br>Fluent in French, Russian, and German, Catherine published political theory, journalism, comedies, operas, and history, while writing thousands of letters as she corresponded with Voltaire and other public figures. The Memoirs of Catherine the Great provides an unparalleled window into eighteenth-century Russia and the mind of an absolute ruler. <br><br>With insight, humor, and candor, Catherine presents her eyewitness account of history, from her whirlwind entry into the Russian court in 1744 at age fourteen as the intended bride of Empress Elizabeth I&#x2019;s nephew, the eccentric drunkard and future Peter III, to her unhappy marriage; from her two children, several miscarriages, and her and Peter&#x2019;s numerous affairs to the political maneuvering that enabled Catherine to seize the throne from him in 1762. Catherine&#x2019;s eye for telling details makes for compelling reading as she describes the dramatic fall and rise of her political fortunes.<br><br>This definitive new translation from the French is scrupulously faithful to her words and is the first for which translators have consulted original manuscripts written in Catherine&#x2019;s own hand.

Karl Friedrich, Duke of Holstein, nephew of Charles XII, King of Sweden, and father of Peter III, was a weak, ugly, short, sickly and poor prince (see Bergholz&#x2019;s journal in B�sching&#x2019;s Magazin). He died in the year 1739 and left his son, who was around eleven years old, under the guardianship of his cousin Adolph Friedrich, the Bishop of L�beck and Duke of Holstein, since chosen King of Sweden as a result of the preliminary talks of the Treaty of �bo on the recommendation of Empress Elizabeth.<br><br>Peter III&#x2019;s education was directed by Br�mmer, the Grand Marshal of the Court and a Swede by birth, and under him were Grand Chamberlain Bergholz, author of the aforementioned journal, and four chamberlains, two of whom&#x2014;Adlerfelt, the author of a history of Charles XII, and Wachmeister&#x2014;were Swedish, and the other two, Wolff and Mardefeld, were from Holstein. They raised the Prince for the throne of Sweden in a court that was too large for the country in which it was located and that was divided into several factions, which hated each other and vied to control the Prince&#x2019;s mind, which each faction wanted to shape. As a result, these factions inspired in him the reciprocal hatred they felt against the individuals they opposed. The young prince politely detested Br�mmer and his overbearing way and accused the Grand Marshal of excessive severity; he despised Bergholz, who was Br�mmer&#x2019;s friend and toady, and liked none of his attendants, because they hampered him.<br><br> From the age of ten, Peter III was partial to drink. He had to make many public appearances and was never out of sight day or night. Those he liked best during his childhood and the first years of his stay in Russia were his two old valets: Kramer, a Livonian, and Romberg, a Swede. The latter was his favorite; he was a rather vulgar and rough man who had been a dragoon officer under Charles XII. Br�mmer and as a result Bergholz, who trusted blindly in Br�mmer, were attached to Adolph Friedrich, Prince Bishop of L�beck and Prince Guardian and Administrator; all the others were unhappy with this Prince and even more with his entourage.<br><br>Once Empress Elizabeth had ascended to the throne of Russia, she sent Chamberlain Korf to Holstein to summon her nephew, whom the Prince Administrator sent off immediately, accompanied by Grand Marshal Br�mmer, Grand Chamberlain Bergholz, and Chamberlain Ducker, Br�mmer&#x2019;s nephew. The Empress&#x2019;s joy was great when he arrived. She left shortly thereafter for her coronation in Moscow.� She was resolved to declare the Prince her heir. But first he had to profess the Greek Orthodox faith. The enemies of Grand Marshal Br�mmer, notably Grand Chancellor Count Bestuzhev and the late Count N. Panin, who had long been Russian minister in Sweden, claimed to have in hand convincing proof that as soon as Br�mmer saw the Empress determined to declare her nephew heir apparent to the throne, he took as much care to spoil the mind and heart of his pupil as he had taken to make him worthy of the Swedish crown.<br><br>But I have always doubted this atrocious allegation and have believed that the education of Peter III was undermined by a clash of unfortunate circumstances. I will relate what I have seen and heard, and that in itself will clarify many things. I saw Peter III for the first time when he was eleven years old, in Eutin at the home of his guardian, the Prince Bishop of L�beck. Some months after the death of Duke Karl Friedrich, Peter III&#x2019;s father, the Prince Bishop had in 1739 assembled all of his family at his home in Eutin to have his ward brought there. My grandmother, mother of the Prince Bishop, and my mother, sister of this same Prince, had come there from Hamburg with me. I was ten years old at the time. Prince August and Princess Anna, brother and sister of the Prince Guardian and Administrator of Holstein, were also there.<br><br>It was then that I heard it said among this assembled family that the young duke was inclined to drink, that his attendants found it difficult to prevent him from getting drunk at meals, that he was restive and hotheaded, did not like his attendants and especially Br�mmer, and that otherwise he showed vivacity, but had a delicate and sickly appearance. In truth, his face was pale in color and he seemed to be thin and of a delicate constitution. His attendants wanted to give this child the appearance of a mature man, and to this end they hampered and restrained him, which could only inculcate falseness in his conduct as well as his character.<br><br>Soon after this Holstein court arrived in Russia, it was followed by a Swedish embassy that requested the Empress allow her nephew to succeed to the Swedish throne. But Elizabeth, who had already declared her intentions in the preliminary talks of the Treaty of �bo, mentioned above, replied to the Swedish Diet that she had already declared her nephew heir to the throne of Russia and that she adhered to the preliminary talks of the Treaty of �bo, which made the Prince Administrator of Holstein heir apparent to the Swedish crown. (This Prince had had an older brother to whom Empress Elizabeth had been engaged after the death of Peter I. The marriage had not taken place, because the prince died of smallpox several weeks after the engagement. Empress Elizabeth retained tender feelings for his memory, and she gave tokens of her affection to the prince&#x2019;s entire family.)<br><br>Peter III was thus declared Elizabeth&#x2019;s heir and Grand Duke of Russia after he professed his faith according to the Greek Orthodox rite; Simeon Theodorsky, since named Archbishop of Pskov, was made his spiritual instructor. The Prince had been baptized and raised in the Lutheran faith, the most rigid and least tolerant, and since his childhood he had always been resistant to all instruction. I heard it said by his attendants that at Kiel it had required great effort to make him go to church on Sundays and feast days, and to make him perform devotional acts, which were forced upon him, and that most of the time he acted irreligiously.<br><br>His Imperial Highness took it into his head to dispute every point with Simeon Theodorsky. Often his attendants were called in to cut short these bitter exchanges and to calm the Prince&#x2019;s heated emotions. Finally, after much frustration, the Prince submitted to the wishes of the Empress, his aunt, although, whether from prejudice, habit, or a contradictory spirit, he often made it known that he would have preferred to leave for Sweden rather than stay in Russia.<br><br>He kept Br�mmer, Bergholz, and his Holstein entourage around him until his marriage. Some other tutors were added to these as a formality: one was Monsieur Isaak Veselovsky for the Russian language, who came at first rarely and eventually not at all; the other, Professor St�hlin, was supposed to teach him math and history, but in truth played with him and practically served as his buffoon. The most conscientious teacher was the ballet master Land�, who taught him to dance.<br><br>During this period, the Grand Duke spent all his time making two servants, who had been assigned for his personal service, perform military exercises in his private chambers. He gave them titles and ranks and demoted them according to his whim. These were truly the games of a child and of perpetual childishness. In general he was still very much a child, although he turned sixteen in 1744 when the Russian court was in Moscow.<br><br>1744<br><br>Catherine&#x2019;s arrival in Russia; Bestuzhev-Riumin and court factions; her illness; her mother&#x2019;s politics at court; her profession of the Orthodox faith and betrothal to Peter; trip to Kiev; Catherine&#x2019;s debts; Peter has measles, then smallpox<br><br>That year, Catherine II arrived with her mother in Moscow on February 9. At that time, the Russian court was divided into two large factions or parties. The leader of the first group, who had begun to recover from his weakened position, was Vice Chancellor Bestuzhev-Riumin. He was infinitely more feared than loved, exceedingly scheming, suspicious, willful, and daring, rather tyrannical in his principles, an implacable enemy, but a friend to his friends, whom he abandoned only when they turned their backs on him, and otherwise hard to get along with and often overly exacting. He was in charge of the department of foreign affairs. Having battled with the Empress&#x2019;s entourage, he had lost ground before the journey to Moscow, but had begun to recover. He supported the courts of Vienna, Saxony, and England. The arrival of Catherine II and her mother gave him no pleasure. It was the secret work of the faction opposed to him. The enemies of Count Bestuzhev were numerous, but he made them all tremble. He had the advantage over them in his position and his character, which gave him immense influence in the politics of the antechamber.<br><br>The party opposed to Bestuzhev supported France, its ally Sweden, and the King of Prussia. The Marquis de la Ch�tardie was its soul and the Holstein court its ringleaders; they had won over Lestocq, one of the principal actors of the revolution that had placed the late Empress Elizabeth on the throne of Russia. Lestocq was greatly trusted by Elizabeth. He had been her personal surgeon since the death of Empress Catherine I, to whom he had also been devoted, and had rendered essential services to both mother and daughter. He lacked neither intelligence, shrewdness, nor capacity for intrigue, but he was malicious and had a black and evil heart...</p><h2>Toll the Hounds (Malazan Book of the Fallen 8)</h2><p>There is a saying in Darujhistan, the city of blue fire, that love and death shall arrive together, dancing . . .<br><br>It is summer and the heat is oppressive. However the discomfiture of the small round man in the faded red waistcoat is not entirely due to the sun. Dire portents plague his nights and haunt the city&#x2019;s streets like fiends of shadow.

His first fantasy novel, the critically acclaimed bestseller, <b>Gardens of the Moon</b>, marked the opening chapter in the epic sequence <b>The Malazan Book of the Fallen.</b>Chapter One <p></p><b>S</b>urrounded in a city of blue fire, she stood alone on the balcony. The sky's darkness was pushed away, an unwelcome guest on this the first night of the Gedderone Fete. Throngs filled the streets of Darujhistan, happily riotous, good- natured in the calamity of one year's ending and another's beginning. The night air was humid and pungent with countless scents. <p></p>There had been banquets. There had been unveilings of eligible young men and maidens. Tables laden with exotic foods, ladies wrapped in silks, men and women in preposterous uniforms all glittering gilt - a city with no standing army bred a plethora of private militias and a chaotic proliferation of high ranks held, more or less exclusively, by the nobility. <p></p>Among the celebrations she had attended this evening, on the arm of her husband, she had not once seen a real officer of Darujhistan's City Watch, not one genuine soldier with a dusty cloak- hem, with polished boots bearing scars, with a sword- grip of plain leather and a pommel gouged and burnished by wear. Yet she had seen, bound high on soft, well- fed arms, torcs in the manner of decorated soldiers among the Malazan army - soldiers from an empire that had, not so long ago, provided for Darujhistan mothers chilling threats to belligerent children. <i>'Malazans, child! Skulking in the night to steal foolish children! To make you slaves for their terrible Empress - yes! Here in this very city!</i>' <p></p>But the torcs she had seen this night were not the plain bronze or faintly etched silver of genuine Malazan decorations and signi.ers of rank, such as appeared like relics from some long- dead cult in the city's market stalls. No, these had been gold, studded with gems, the blue of sapphire being the commonest hue even among the coloured glass, blue like the blue .re for which the city was famous, blue to proclaim some great and brave service to Darujhistan itself. <p></p>Her fingers had pressed upon one such torc, there on her husband's arm, although there was real muscle beneath it, a hardness to match the contemptuous look in his eyes as he surveyed the clusters of nobility in the vast humming hall, with the proprietary air he had acquired since attaining the Council. The contempt had been there long before and if anything had grown since his latest and most triumphant victory. <p></p>Daru gestures of congratulation and respect had swirled round them in their stately passage through the crowds, and with each acknowledgement her husband's face had grown yet harder, the arm beneath her fingers drawing ever tauter, the knuckles of his hands whitening above his sword- belt where the thumbs were tucked into braided loops in the latest fashion among duellists. Oh, he revelled in being among them now; indeed, in being above many of them. But for Gorlas Vidikas, this did not mean he had to like any of them. The more they fawned, the deeper his contempt, and that he would have been offended without their obsequy was a contradiction, she suspected, that a man like her husband was not wont to entertain. <p></p>The nobles had eaten and drunk, and stood and posed and wandered and paraded and danced themselves into swift exhaustion, and now the banquet halls and staterooms echoed with naught but the desultory ministrations of servants. Beyond the high walls of the estates, however, the common folk rollicked still in the streets. Masked and half naked, they danced on the cobbles - the riotous whirling steps of the Flaying of Fander - as if dawn would never come, as if the hazy moon itself would stand motionless in the abyss in astonished witness to their revelry. City Watch patrols simply stood back and observed, drawing dusty cloaks about their bodies, gauntlets rustling as they rested hands on truncheons and swords. <p></p>On the balcony where she stood, the fountain of the unlit garden directly below chirped and gurgled to itself, buffered by the estate's high, solid walls from the raucous festivities they had witnessed during the tortured carriage ride back home. Smeared moonlight struggled in the softly swirling pool surrounding the fountain. <p></p>The blue fire was too strong this night, too strong even for the mournful moon. Darujhistan itself was a sapphire, blazing in the torc of the world. And yet its beauty, and all its delighted pride and its multitudinous voice, could not reach her tonight. <p></p>This night, Lady Vidikas had seen her future. Each and every year of it. There on her husband's hard arm. And the moon, well, it looked like a thing of the past, a memory dimmed by time, yet it had taken her back. <p></p>To a balcony much like this one in a time that now seemed very long ago. <p></p>Lady Vidikas, who had once been Challice Estraysian, had just seen her future. And was discovering, here in this night and standing against this rail, that the past was a better place to be. <p></p>Talk about the worst night yet to run out of Rhivi flatbread. Swearing under her breath, Picker pushed her way through the crowds of the Lakefront market, the mobs of ferociously hungry, drunk revellers, using her elbows when she needed to and glowering at every delirious smile swung her way, and came out eventually at the mouth of a dingy alley heaped ankle- deep in rubbish. Somewhere just to the south of Borthen Park. Not quite the route back to the bar she would have preferred, but the fete was in full frenzy. Wrapped package of flatbread tucked under her left arm, she paused to tug loose the tangles of her heavy cloak, scowled on seeing a fresh stain from a careless passer- by - some grotesque Gadrobi sweetcake - tried wiping it off which only made it worse, then, her mood even fouler, set out through the detritus. <p></p>With the Lady's pull, Bluepearl and Antsy had fared better in finding Saltoan wine and were even now back at K'rul's. And here she was, twelve streets and two wall passages away with twenty or thirty thousand mad fools in between. Would her companions wait for her? Not a chance. Damn Blend and her addiction to Rhivi flatbread! That and her sprained ankle had conspired to force Picker out here on the first night of the fete - if that ankle truly <i>was</i> sprained, and she had her doubts since Mallet had just squinted down at the offending appendage, then shrugged. <p></p>Mind you, that was about as much as anyone had come to expect from Mallet. He'd been miserable since the retirement, and the chance of the sun's rising any time in the healer's future was about as likely as Hood's forgetting to tally the count. And it wasn't as if he was alone in his misery, was it? <p></p>But where was the value in feeding her ill temper with all these well- chewed thoughts? Well, it made her feel better, that's what. <p></p>Dester Thrin, wrapped tight in black cloak and hood, watched the big- arsed woman kicking her way through the rubbish at the other end of the alley. He'd picked her up coming out of the back door of K'rul's Bar, the culmination of four nights positioned in the carefully chosen, darkness- shrouded vantage point from which he could observe that narrow postern. <p></p>His clan- master had warned that the targets were all ex- soldiers, but Dester Thrin had seen little to suggest that any of them had kept .t and trim. They were old, sagging, rarely sober, and this one, well, she wore that huge, thick woollen cloak because she was getting heavy and it clearly made her self- conscious. <p></p>Following her through the crowds had been relatively easy - she was a head taller than the average Gadrobi, and the route she took to this decrepit Rhivi market in Lakefront seemed to deliberately avoid the Daru streets, some strange affectation that would, in a very short time, prove fatal. <p></p>Dester's own Daru blood had permitted him a clear view of his target, pushing purposefully through the heaving press of celebrants. <p></p>He set out to traverse the alley once his target exited at the far end. Swiftly padding at a hunter's pace, he reached the alley mouth and edged out, in time to see the woman move into the passageway through Second Tier Wall, with the tunnel through Third just beyond. <p></p>The Guild's succession wars, following the disappearance of Vorcan, had finally been settled, with only a minimum amount of spilled blood. And Dester was more or less pleased with the new Grand Master, who was both vicious and clever where most of the other aspirants had been simply vicious. At last, an assassin of the Guild did not have to be a fool to feel some optimism regarding the future. <p></p>This contract was a case in point. Straightforward, yet one sure to earn Dester and the others of his clan considerable prestige upon its summary completion. <p></p>He brushed his gloved hands across the pommels of his daggers, the weapons slung on baldrics beneath his arms. Ever reassuring, those twin blades of Daru steel with their ferules filled with the thick, pasty poison of Moranth tralb. <p></p>Poison was now the preferred insurance for a majority of the Guild's street killers, and indeed for more than a few who scuttled Thieves' Road across the rooftops. There'd been an assassin, close to Vorcan herself, who had, on a night of betrayal against his own clan, demonstrated the deadliness of fighting without magic. Using poison, the assassin had proved the superiority of such mundane substances in a single, now legendary night of blood. <p></p>Dester had heard that some initiates in some clans had raised hidden shrines to honour Rallick Nom, creating a kind of cult whose adherents employed secret gestures of mutual recognition within the Guild. Of course, Seba Krafar, the new Grand Master, had in one of his very first pronouncements outlawed the cult, and there had been a cull of sorts, with five suspected cult leaders greeting the dawn with smiling throats. <p></p>Still, Dester had since heard enough hints to suggest that the cult was far from dead. It had just burrowed deeper. <p></p>In truth, no one knew which poisons Rallick Nom had used, but Dester believed it was Moranth tralb, since even the smallest amount in the bloodstream brought unconsciousness, then a deeper coma that usually ...</p><h2>The Watch Buff&#39;s Book of Trivia</h2><p>465 Fun Facts About Timepieces</p><p></p><h2>Liverworts of New England: A Guide for the Amateur Naturalist (Memoirs of The New York Botanical Garden, Volume 99)</h2><p>Liverworts of New England is volume 99 of the Memoirs of The New York Botanical Garden series.

Young couples who had previously rented accommodation in urban centers found themselves able to afford new-build homes with hot running water, a bathroom indoors, and even aerials for the wireless already installed. Some four million houses were erected, and interest in interior home decoration boomed. This fully illustrated book introduces the homes that people fell in love with in the 1930s, and the fixtures and fittings that went in them. It is not only a practical and valuable companion for people who own or wish to renovate an inter-war house, but will also appeal to all those interested in period design.</p><p>Dr. Greg Stevenson is an architectural historian.

His best works include Green Lantern/Green Arrow and Batman with Neal Adams, The Shadow with Mike Kaluta and The Question with Denys Cowan, all of which were hailed for sophisticated stories that expanded the artistic potential of the mainstream portion of the medium. As an editor, he is principally known for editing Batman. His 1970s run on Batman is perhaps his most well known endeavour, turning Batman from the campiness of the 1960s TV show, to &#34;The Batman&#34;, getting back to the character&#39;s darker roots and emphasizing his detective skills. This grimer and more sophisticated Dark Knight, as well as new villians such as Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, brought back Batman from the verge of pop culture oblivion. His work would influence later incarnations of Batman, from the seminal comic &#34;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&#34; by Frank Miller, to the movie Batman Begins in 2005.ne of Adams' early triumphs involved revitalizing one of comics' greatest icons. In the waning days of the TV series <i>Batman</i>, which depicted the character as a genial battler against silly, costumed villains, Adams and some sympathetic writers returned to the crime fighter's roots as a dark creature of the night driven to avenge his parents' double murder. Besides conjuring a noirish atmosphere (intensified here by good recoloring), Adams goosed up the thrills with exciting, kinetic fight choreography. The 1970s stories reprinted in this attractive, pricey hardcover range from moody ghost stories set in haunted houses to more traditional superhero scenarios, such as the trilogy in which Batman fights the Man-Bat, a scientist transformed into a giant flying fiend. More than three decades after these comics first appeared, Adams' conception of Batman remains the template for today's renditions of the Caped Crusader. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In what is essentially a history of mass-produced tackiness, Peter Ward provides insightful commentary on how good taste becomes officially bad when its audience changes. He also catches the sense of humor of Jeff Koons, who appears just a few pages past the Bay City Rollers, a juxtaposition I'm sure Koons would enjoy. <i>Kitsch in Sync</i> is worthwhile for its novel take on '80s new romantic music and for the illustrations of the postwar culture of disposable and ugly home furnishings.</p><h2>Art from Africa: Long Steps Never Broke a Back</h2><p><p>This strikingly unusual and beautifully illustrated book represents a turning point in African art history. The authors draw on personal memories, interviews, and oral narratives to present twelve "case histories" of objects--or clusters of objects--in the Seattle Art Museum's renowned collection of African art. Each case history is enriched by comments from artists, art historians, writers, community members, and patrons who guide readers back into the markets, palaces, ceremonies, shrines, and streets where African art originated.</p><br><p> Often sitting still and silent in a museum display case, African art is frozen in an alien frame. Vibrant music, movement, debate, and cryptic voices are among the missing elements that once surrounded the mask, sculpture, ring, or stool. Reframing the objects, <i>Art from Africa</i> proposes looking at what was once done with them while also listening carefully to what was once said in their presence. As the case histories reveal, the gross mislabeling of objects as "fetishes," "idols," and "devil masks" dissolves as art becomes better known as medicine, philosophy, personality correctives, and blessings for the future.</p><br><p> Known for his scintillating analyses of African art, Robert Farris Thompson devotes his opening essay to introducing the missing dimension of motion, exploring the meaning of postures and gestures in various African cultures. A curator dedicated to telling the stories behind such art, Pamela McClusky explores subjects ranging from royal art of the Kom and Asante kingdoms, masquerades from the Yoruba, Dan, and Mende cultures, hunters&#x2019; shirts from the Mande empire, sculpture from the Kongo kingdom, Mercedes-Benz coffins from the streets of Ghana, photographs from Mali, and Maasai body ornaments. This book accompanies a special exhibition of the museum's collection, but, as all art lovers who look beyond museum walls will appreciate, it is much more than an exhibition catalogue.</p><br><p> EXHIBITION SCHEDULE</p><br><p> http://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/ Philadelphia Museum of Art<br>October 2, 2004 - January 2, 2005.</p></p><p>Winner of Washington State Book Award<p>"This innovative work allows the objects it covers to breathe as living things.

BAKER &amp; TAYLOR</p><p>A ninth excursion into England's Cornwall, where the tiny Order of the Sisters of Compassion struggles to make ends meet and the Order's Sister Joan keeps getting involved in local police concerns (A Vow of Poverty, 1996, etc.). Walking one day into the empty schoolhouse on the moors where she'd once taught, Sister Joan finds the body of a man--his pockets empty of any identification. She calls the police station from a nearby dwelling where the friendly Mrs. Rufus keeps house for antiques dealer Michael Peter. The coroner pronounces the stranger's death a heart attack, and the case is closed. Meanwhile, Sister Joan has been approached by Caroline Hayes, a distraught young woman looking for her sister Crystal, recently married to Michael Peter. She and her invalid father were not invited to the wedding and haven't heard from Crystal in two months. Sister Joan, in conversation with Mrs. Rufus, was told that Crystal and her family were traveling on the Continent, an account confirmed by Michael Peter when Sister Joan visits his shop in town. In another foray to the Peter residence, Sister Joan uncovers hidden identification papers carrying the name of Crystal's father, purported by Caroline to be in the hospital. A robbery at Peter's house; Caroline's disappearance; a suitcase full of women's clothing found on a railway embankment; and a seemingly senseless murder lead our heroine to the bizarre scene where the even more bizarre answers to her questions are to be found. An exasperating jumble of convent routine, mini-sermons, contrivance, and coincidence. Strictly for Sister Joan's faithful fans. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>YA-A satisfying tale of mystery and murder. While exercising the convent's pony on the Cornish moors, Sister Joan stops to inspect an abandoned chapel. The body of the man she finds there seems to indicate foul play perpetrated by the landowner, Michael Peter. When Peter's wife is found to be missing, her sister shows up to enlist Sister Joan's help in locating her, and the two plots begin their slow merger toward several surprises and a unique ending. The interesting mix of seemingly incongruent story elements continues as Detective Sergeant Alan Mill and Sister Joan deepen their ties of loyalty and friendship. Black controls her characters with practiced ambiguity, building the events and factors of the murder around the people involved. The strength of the personalities allows the events to unfold naturally and come together dramatically. Leads that seem to have no connection, clues that appear to have no meaning, and details that casually surface all swirl together, producing one surprise after another. The pace is kept lively even during the digressions into contemporary convent life and routines.

In From Cochise to Geronimo, Edwin R.

In 1876 and 1877, the U.S. government proposed moving the Chiricahuas from their ancestral homelands in New Mexico and Arizona to the San Carlos Reservation. Some made the move, but most refused to go or soon fled the reviled new reservation, viewing the government's concentration policy as continued U.S. perfidy. Bands under the leadership of Victorio and Geronimo went south into the Sierra Madre of Mexico, a redoubt from which they conducted bloody raids on American soil.</p><p>Sweeney draws on American and Mexican archives, some only recently opened, to offer a balanced account of life on and off the reservation in the 1870s and 1880s. <i>From Cochise to Geronimo</i> details the Chiricahuas' ordeal in maintaining their identity despite forced relocations, disease epidemics, sustained warfare, and confinement.

When she falls into a crevasse, she finds she has followed her uncle farther than she thought-to Norchester, England, in 1657. Times are dark: the ruling Puritans have beheaded the king and prohibited song, dance, and even Christmas. Though she passes as a boy with her short hair and pants, local official Noah Fallam is still suspicious of her strange clothing and outspokenness. Luckily, she soon finds her uncle, and another man: the Raven, a bandit who provides for the poor through smuggling and robbery. The unlikely couple fall in love, and Lydde must decide where-and when-she belongs. This captivating story brings us close to Denise Giardina's signature concerns of faith and the way we treat the earth.</p><p>Denise Giardina is the author of Storming Heaven, Emily&#39;s Ghost, and Saints and Villains, which won the Boston Book Review Prize. She is an ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church and lives in Charleston, West Virginia.Giardina (Storming Heaven) constructs an intriguing time-travel narrative steeped in the history of West Virginia. After her family died in a fire in 1948, two-year-old Lydde Falcone was taken in by her Uncle John and Aunt Lavinia and grew up with them in West Virginia. Now a middle-aged actress living in Norchester, England, Lydde returns to West Virginia to take care of her aunt after John's death. There, she learns that John, a physicist, believed he had discovered a hole in the time/space continuum. She follows his map to some caves near her aunt's house, pokes around and suddenly finds herself back in England-England of 1657, that is, where she finds her uncle alive and well. Passing as a man thanks to her outlandish clothes and forward manner, Lydde attracts the suspicion of Noah Fallam, a local Puritan official who upholds Oliver Cromwell's ban on music and art and turns out to be an ancestor of hers (his brother becomes one of the first Englishmen to come to Appalachia in 1671). She also falls for the Raven, a sort of Robin Hood who steals from rich Puritans to give to the poor. Lydde's rapid adjustment to her 17th-century surroundings is hard to swallow, as is her instant love for the Raven. Yet Giardina is an accomplished storyteller, and the narrative is rich in detail. The despoliation of West Virginia's mountains by mining companies, a familiar theme of Giardina's, adds complexity to the plot. While this book doesn't carry the literary weight of some of her previous work, it's a captivating read.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Old Fishing Lures and Tackle: An Identification and Value Guide</h2><p><p>"The long-awaited 8th edition of <i>Old Fishing Lures &amp; Tackle</i> -"the bible for lures collectors"- has been thoroughly updated, combining the time-honored research of the late Carl F.

The first Jewish immigrants came in a small trickle during the middle of the nineteenth century, and then in larger numbers during the open-door era that stretched to 1924. They included Ashkenazim primarily from the cities, towns, and shtetls of central and eastern Europe and Sephardim from the Mediterranean Basin. Followed by European Jews fleeing persecution by the Nazis and discrimination by the Soviet Union, they grew in number with the arrival of American Jews who were part of the great westward movement in the postwar era. Isolated from the large centers of American Jewish life, speaking different languages -- German, Yiddish, Ladino, and others -- and following different religious customs, initially these groups had little in common other than their identification as Jews. Yet they succeeded in developing a community whose members made notable contributions to the civic and cultural history of Washington State. Regional politics, lively neighborhood histories, local responses to the plight of Europe&#39;s Jews during World War II, commercial and business enterprises, detailed histories of congregations, organizational philanthropy and social work, and the contributions of Washington&#39;s Jewish musicians and artists are presented in this generously illustrated book, often through the voices of those who took part. The vibrant life stories of dozens of notable local individuals are embedded in the overall context of how the Jews of Washington State organized a group of complementary and thriving cultural and religious communities.

But which ones can you trust? Some are effective, some are useless, some are harmful. Some involve forms of spirituality that the Bible expressly forbids. Others that are truly helpful have been avoided by some Christians who draw inaccurate conclusions about them. Alternative Medicine is the first comprehensive guidebook to non-traditional medicine written from a distinctively Christian perspective. Here at last is the detailed and balanced coverage of alternative medicine that you&#39;ve been looking for. Professor and researcher Donal O&#39;Mathuna, Ph.D., and national medical authority Walt Larimore, M.D., draw on their extensive knowledge of the Bible and their medical and pharmaceutical expertise to answer the questions about alternative medicine that you most want answered---and others you wouldn&#39;t have thought to ask. This massively informative resource includes: Two alphabetical reference sections: - Alternative therapies - Herbal remedies Entries include an analysis of claims, results of actual studies, cautions, recommendations, and further resources. A handy cross-reference that links specific health problems with various alternative therapies and herbal remedies reviewed in this book. Five categories of alternative medicine defined and then applied to every therapy and remedy evaluated in this book.</p><p>Donal O&#39;Mathuna, PhD, has degrees in pharmacy, medicinal chemistry, and theology (focused on bioethics). He is a lecturer in healthcare ethics in the School of Nursing at Dublin City University, Ireland. Dr. O&#39;Mathuna&#39;s long-time interest in alternative medicine has led to many publications in professional journals and the general media. He lives in Dunboyne, Co. Meath, Ireland. Donal O&#39;Mathuna, PhD, es grado en farmacia, medicina quimica, y teologia (con un concentracion en bioeticas). Es un lector en eticas de asistencia sanitaria a la escuela de enfermeria en Dublin City University, Ireland. Dr. O&#39;Mathuna ha publicado en revistas profesionales y media general porque de su gran interes en medicina alternativo. Vive en Dunboyne, Co. Meath, Ireland.Some Christians have feared the growing interest in alternative medicine, thinking that the Bible condemns techniques such as biofeedback, meditation, herbal remedies and acupuncture. This comprehensive guide should put their minds at ease. Geared for Christians with little or no experience of alternative therapies, this book examines chiropractic care, hypnosis, T'ai Chi, yoga, visualization, homeopathy and aromatherapy, among other practices. O'Math�na, a professor of bioethics and chemistry, and Larimore, a physician who hosts a nationally syndicated television program, navigate a middle ground, approving of some therapies while advising caution on others. The Hallelujah Diet (a popular vegetarian Christian diet), for example, earns high marks for its emphasis on biblical nutrition, while marijuana is not recommended, despite beneficial results in treating some diseases. Yoga is fine as a complementary practice that "can improve general well-being," but it "is antithetical to biblical Christianity" when used "as a deeply religious practice with the goal of union with the divine." Throughout, the authors discuss affinities between alternative and traditional medicine, showing, for example, that prescription drugs are sometimes derived from herbal remedies (such as aspirin from willow bark). They caution readers to give more credence to therapies that have been clinically tested in randomly controlled trials. Always, they promote the theological idea that Christians' bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. Many readers will appreciate straight talk on health that is informed by both medical science and the Bible. (June)Forecast: Larimore's name recognition as host of the cable TV show Ask the Family Doctor (America's Health Network) should boost sales for this manual, which taps into a growing market in Christian health books.

Roger started teaching tenor banjo in 1923. With his experience of playing in the Dixieland music era, he quickly became aware that the succession of chords C, E7, A7, D7, G7, back to C, followed by C7, F, Fm, and then ending with C, A7, D7, G7 to C would train almost any interested student to cope with the &#34;faking&#34; required of banjo players in that era. He taught this sequence of chords in all reasonable keys to all of his students. Beginning in the mid-1920&#39;s, Roger taught countless students to play banjo, steel guitar, Spanish guitar, and bass at his studio in New Orleans. After many years of teaching, he published his first book, the Melody Chord System for Spanish Guitar, with Forster in 1936. This publication was followed by a similar book for guitar, Chord Construction and Harmony as Applied to the Guitar, published by Gibson. The Gibson steel guitar book was later republished by Mel Bay Publications, Inc., with a comprehensive one-volume edition issued in 1968 under the title Complete Steel Guitar Method.</p><h2>The Heir and the Spare (Negligent Chaperone Series)</h2><p>Beautiful yet extremely klutzy Emilia Highhard, in London for her first season, sets her sights on Lord Phillip, a most unsuitable candidate for her affections who is not what he seems.

A retired couple, Gerry and Stella Gilmore, fly from their home in Scotland to Amsterdam for a long weekend&#x2015;a holiday to refresh the senses, to do some sightseeing, and generally to take stock of what remains of their lives. Their relationship seems safe, easy, familiar.

Stella is tired of his lifestyle, worried about their marriage, and angry at his constant undermining of her religious faith.

As their midwinter break comes to an end, we understand how far apart they are&#x2015;and can only watch as they struggle to save themselves.</p><p>MacLaverty is a master storyteller, and <em>Midwinter Break</em> is the essential MacLaverty novel: accurate, compassionate observation; effortlessly elegant writing; and a tender, intimate, heartrending story.

High-living Albert Edward ("Bertie"), Prince of Wales, who made his detective debut in Lovesey's Bertie and the Tinman , is the fumbling sleuth and rakish narrator, loosely modeled on the real-life prince who became King Edward VII. Bertie discovers that the nursery rhyme "Monday's child is fair of face . . . " holds the key; each line of the poem points to the next victim. Among the dwindling group of party guests, one of whom is the murderer, are an Amazon explorer, a stuttering poet and a scheming actress. Half the fun of this romp lies in watching Bertie invent, then discard, one theory after another; for a while his suspicions even fall on the widowed hostess he wants to bed. The other half comes from Lovesey's light mockery of Victorian manners and sexual mores in a bright, entertaining tale whose bantering tone conceals artful plotting. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Firearms of the American West, 1866-1894</h2><p>Traces the development of rifles, pistols, carbines, and other weapons and examines the impact of firearms on the history of the West</p><p>After graduating from Western Michigan University, <b>Louis A.

No subject has attracted more vigorous discussion within the community of poets and critics in the past ten years. If we are to understand what form is and how it shapes poetic expression, we must turn to the poems themselves for clues. And if we are very lucky, we can listen to the voice of the poets who wrote them. <br>&nbsp;In <i>Ecstatic Occasions, Expedient Forms,</i> contemporary poets have selected one poem, commenting on the occasion of its creation and on the form the poem eventually took. Originally published in 1987 with a selection of 65 poets, this revised and expanded edition adds selections by twenty additional poets. Other revisions include an enlarged glossary of terms, and more expanded biographies of individual poets. The range of contributors is wide, and includes John Ashbery, John Cage, Rita Dove, Alice Fulton, Marilyn Hacker, Yusef Komunyakaa, James Merrill, Thylias Moss, Robert Pinsky, Charles Simic, and Richard Wilbur. Among the new contributions is Wyn Cooper's poem "Fun," which was the basis for Sheryl Crow's Grammy-award winning song "All I Wanna Do."</p><p>This unique anthology brings together 85 contemporary poets to conduct a lively, instructive forum on the question of form in poetry. Editor David Lehman asked each poet to select a poem and describe the method of its composition, the circumstances of the writing, and the formal decisions that were made. Pairing poem with prose, the book manages to define, exemplify, and explain the range of formal possibilities available to the contemporary poet, through its broad formal variety and intimate style of commentary.This enjoyable romp through the thoughts of 85 poets is a lark masquerading as a colossus. When writers from John Ashbery to Charles Wright talk about their work, you might expect Deep Thoughts, but it is surprising (and fun) to read how even the most erudite poet can be as uncertain as the next person. Lehman, editor of this second edition (the first was published by Macmillan in 1987), observed in the original preface that the work is intended to be "perfectly emblematic of the poetic process itself"; but a new preface sees the volume merely as "a chance to eavesdrop on poets talking shop." It's a treat to listen to, among others, Frank Bidart ("Forms are the language of desire before desire has found its object"), Maria Flook ("In `Discreet,' I seem to be talking about poetry itself, how I failed in it or how it was lost from me") and John Cage ("Using MESOMAKE, a program made at my request... I chose to have it triggered with the first three words of the text"). With 20 poems--and accompanying commentary--added to those of the first edition, this revised anthology offers a rewarding glimpse of the passion and restraint, the control and the chaos, the artifice and the chance at work in those who practice poetry. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Vendetta: High Art and Low Cunning at the Birth of the Renaissance</h2><p>In Italy, the Renaissance was more than a time of sweeping cultural advancement; it was also an age of nearly continuous military conflict and vicious personal feuds between powerful public figures. A lifelong vendetta pitted two of Italy&#x2019;s most prominent <i>condottieri</i>, or mercenary warlords, against each other in a struggle that moved from the battlefield to the political halls of power to the papacy itself. Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, and Sigismondo Malatesta, the Wolf of Rimini,&#x201d; were more than ruthless generals; they were cultured patrons of the arts who nonetheless took their rivalry to bloody excess. Here their story is set against the rich backdrop of 15th-century Italy, a sweeping epic of nobility and war, betrayals and vengeance. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Hugh Bicheno has had careers as an academic, an intelligence officer, and a freelance kidnap and ransom negotiator in South America.

Nietzsche questioned what it means for us to live in our modern world. He was an 'anti-philosopher' who expressed grave reservations about the reliability and extent of human knowledge. His radical scepticism disturbs our most deeply held beliefs and values. For these reasons, Nietzsche casts a 'long shadow' on the complex cultural and philosophical phenomenon we now call 'postmodernism'. <p>"Nietzsche and Postmodernism" explains the key ideas of this 'Anti-Christ' philosopher. It then provides a clear account of the central themes of postmodernist thought exemplified by such thinkers as Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard and Rorty, and concludes by asking if Nietzsche can justifiably be called the first great postmodernist.</p></p><p>Dave Robinson has taught philosophy for many years. He is the author of Icon/Totem&#39;s introductory guides to Philosophy, Ethics and Descartes. He thinks that Nietzsche is a postmodernist, but he&#39;s not sure.Nietzsche is an important philosopher because he was the first to recognise what being 'modern' really means for Western Europeans. He saw that two thousand years of belief in Christian values was coming to an end, and that this meant that our individual lives no longer had any purpose or meaning. Even worse, nearly all of the key ideas and values of Western thought were just 'metaphysics', without foundation, and he believed that this devastating fact woiuld have to be confronted honestly. He finally suggested the need for 'new people' who would understand and celebrate the new state of affairs. And all of these disturbing ideas he expressed in an extraordinary way: <p>"At last the horizon appears free again to us, even granted that it's not bright, at last our ships may venture out again...the sea, our sea lies open again; perhaps there has never been such an 'open sea'." </p><p>Nietzsche knew he was a prophet. Photographs of him usually reveal a man with a ridiculous walrus moustache and wild staring eyes. He always thought he was writing for a more appreciative future audience, and described himself as a 'posthumous' philosopher. So, one hundred years later, perhaps we are that audience and he is the first great postmodernist...</p></p><h2>Who Owns the Sun?</h2><p>This is a special reprinting of WHO OWNS THE SUN? and is also a part of THE FIVE IN A ROW curriculum. <p>WHO OWNS THE SUN? is a powerful plea for freedom!

In Who Owns the Sun?, 14-year-old Chbosky has written a lyrical tale of the need for freedom and of the dignity of the human spirit. A young black boy observes the wonders of nature and asks his father who owns them. Although told that no one can "own" such marvels, the boy learns that his father--this man whom he reveres above all else--is, indeed, owned by another. The Half &amp; Half Dog, by 12-year-old Gross, is a story of tolerance, of a dog learning that he is worthy of love, and that his unusual appearance makes him special. Joshua Disobeys, by six-year-old Vollmer, tells the story of a young whale that fails to heed its mother's warning and is dangerously beached until it is rescued by an angry yet ever-devoted parent. The book can serve well as a starting point for discussions on parent/child relations, and the two pages of facts on whales will make it a suitable choice for units on whaling. While the strength of the books lies in their texts, the watercolor and marker illustrations have pronounced colors and are often suggestive of expressionistic styles. These books will prove worthwhile additions for promoting values discussions and in encouraging creative writing. --Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, Wheeler School, Providence, R.I.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, Vol. 3: Death of Spider-Man Prelude</h2><p>Super-hero school is in session!

The 16 articles include contributions from some of the biggest names in the anti-creationism field: Wesley Elsberry demolishes the concept of complexity promoted by William Dembski, while several contributors demonstrate that Dembski defines his terms idiosyncratically, in a manner that scientists have not found productive, and that his mathematics and logic are wanting. Similarly, ample evidence is presented to show that Michael Behe's best examples of irreducible complexity have been found to have simpler versions indicating how they could have evolved. Individually, the chapters are well written for a general audience. Collectively, however, there is a fair amount of repetition, The best chapters directly take on the claims of creationists and promoters of intelligent design; less engaging and useful are chapters that largely ignore the controversy and present detailed evolutionary information. Nonetheless, there is much to help readers gain a robust understanding of the current controversy. Indeed, the point is very clearly made that the battle is a political one and not one of scientific substance. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet one unsolved crime has always haunted him: the mysterious disappearance of his parents, in old Shanghai, when he was a small boy. Moving between London and Shanghai of the inter-war years, WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS is a remarkable story of memory, intrigue and the need to return.</p><p>When 9-year-old Christopher Banks's father--a British businessman involved in the opium trade--disappears from the family home in Shanghai, the boy and his friend Akira play at being detectives: "Until in the end, after the chases, fist-fights and gun-battles around the warren-like alleys of the Chinese districts, whatever our variations and elaborations, our narratives would always conclude with a magnificent ceremony held in Jessfield Park, a ceremony that would see us, one after another, step out onto a specially erected stage ... to greet the vast cheering crowds."<p> But Christopher's mother also disappears, and he is sent to live in England, where he grows up in the years between the world wars to become, he claims, a famous detective. His family's fate continues to haunt him, however, and he sifts through his memories to try to make sense of his loss. Finally, in the late 1930s, he returns to Shanghai to solve the most important case of his life. But as Christopher pursues his investigation, the boundaries between fact and fantasy begin to evaporate. Is the Japanese soldier he meets really Akira? Are his parents really being held in a house in the Chinese district? And who is Mr. Grayson, the British official who seems to be planning an important celebration? "My first question, sir, before anything else, is if you're happy with the choice of Jessfield Park for the ceremony? We will, you see, require substantial space."</p><p> In <i>When We Were Orphans</i> Kazuo Ishiguro uses the conventions of crime fiction to create a moving portrait of a troubled mind, and of a man who cannot escape the long shadows cast by childhood trauma. Sherlock Holmes needed only fragments--a muddy shoe, cigarette ash on a sleeve--to make his deductions, but all Christopher has are fading recollections of long-ago events, and for him the truth is much harder to grasp. Ishiguro writes in the first person, but from the beginning there are cracks in Christopher's carefully restrained prose, suggestions that his version of the world may not be the most reliable. Faced with such a narrator, the reader is forced to become a detective too, chasing crumbs of truth through the labyrinth of Christopher's memory. </p><p> Ishiguro has never been one for verbal pyrotechnics, but the unruffled surface of this haunting novel only adds to its emotional power. <i>When We Were Orphans</i> is an extraordinary feat of sustained, perfectly controlled imagination, and in Christopher Banks the author has created one of his most memorable characters. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Man from Primrose Lane: A Novel</h2><p><p>A mind-bending, genre-twisting debut novel</p><p>In West Akron, Ohio, there lived a reclusive elderly man who always wore mittens, even in July. He had no friends and no family; all over town, he was known as the Man from Primrose Lane. And on a summer day, someone murdered him.</p><p>Fast-forward four years. David Neff, the bestselling author of a true-crime book about an Ohio serial killer, is a broken man after his wife's inexplicable suicide. When an unexpected visit from an old friend introduces him to the strange mystery of "the man with a thousand mittens," David decides to investigate. What he finds draws him back into a world he thought he had left behind forever. And the closer David gets to uncovering the true identity of the Man from Primrose Lane, the more he begins to understand the dangerous power of his own obsessions and how they may be connected to the deaths of both the old hermit and his beloved wife.</p><p>Deviously plotted and full of dark wit, James Renner's <i>The Man from Primrose Lane </i>is an audacious debut that boasts as many twists as a roller coaster. But beneath its turns, it's a spellbinding story about our obsessions: the dangerous sway they have over us and the fates of those we love.</p></p><p><p>James Renner is the author of two books of nonfiction that detail his adventures in investigative journalism: <i>Amy: My Search for Her Killer </i>and <i>The Serial Killer's Apprentice</i>. His work has been featured in <i>Best American Crime Reporting </i>and <i>Best Creative Nonfiction</i>. He lives in Ohio.</p>EPISODE ONE<br>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO DAVID NEFF<br>&nbsp;<br><br>David Neff missed a lot of things about his wife, but the thing he missed the most was the way she used to sit on couches, leaning against one giant pillow, her knees tucked up against her chest, her legs trailing behind her as she watched a Lifetime movie or some ridiculous reality show. He pointed out to her once, before she died, that no man ever sits on a couch like that, that it was a uniquely feminine trait. It was a little thing that delighted him. He loved the carefree way she moved her feet to the rhythm of the lights on the screen. When he finally went through her things two months after she was in the ground, he&#x2019;d found a photograph of her as a child, curled up on her parents&#x2019; sofa in the exact manner he remembered. He&#x2019;d stuck the photo to the refrigerator. It was still there, next to the over-outlined caricature drawings of their four-year-old boy.<br>Like most Thursday afternoons, David was on the living room floor, in front of the couch&#x2014;her couch&#x2014;with a bowl of SpaghettiOs in his lap, a bag of Kettle Chips to his right, watching an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants he&#x2019;d seen five times, but TiVo&#x2019;d anyway. The boy, Tanner, napped upstairs.<br>David was a once-handsome man who had grown pudgy around the edges. His dark hair hung too long above his eyes, a bit too gray for thirty-four. Three-day-old stubble shaded his double chin. A dollop of dried ketchup was smeared across the front of his shirt, evidence of the barely won battle that had been Tanner&#x2019;s lunch.<br>The room around David appeared to be the remnants of a livable space that had been torn apart by some sort of laundry- and toy-filled IED. Every other week, Tanner&#x2019;s great-aunt came by and picked the boy&#x2019;s clothes off the mantel, lamps, and ceiling fan, laundered them, and returned them, folded, to the boy&#x2019;s bedroom dresser. She collected the broken robots into dustbins, sorted stuffed frogs and Legos into their assorted tubs, and replaced the batteries in the boy&#x2019;s plastic-ball shooter and tiny grand piano. It only took them two days to get the room out of order again. David didn&#x2019;t mind the mess. And neither did Tanner.<br>Because his wife&#x2019;s death had been ruled a suicide, her insurance had not paid out and David had not been able to work a single day since. But he and the boy didn&#x2019;t need the money. Royalties from David&#x2019;s first book&#x2014;<i>The Serial Killer&#x2019;s Prot�g�</i>&#x2014;had climbed to the seven-figure mark a couple years ago and sales remained strong, thanks, in part, to a <i>Rolling Stone</i> article that had forever labeled him as &#x201c;the best true crime writer since Truman Capote.&#x201d; David no longer kept track of how much he had in the bank, but he knew it was more than he&#x2019;d ever imagined making in his life.<br>After his wife&#x2019;s death and until just a moment from right now, David had resigned himself to the fact that <i>The Serial Killer&#x2019;s Prot�g�</i> would also be his only book, and that that was okay, because Tanner was alive and he could live out the remainder of his days keeping his boy safe and comfortable and happy.<br>But then there was a knock at the front door.<br>David wasn&#x2019;t expecting company. Tanner&#x2019;s aunt wasn&#x2019;t due for a few days. He assumed it was a neighborhood kid pushing school band&#x2013;sale candy, so he ignored it. But then the knock came again, too loud to be anything but an adult.<br>He walked to the door and peered through the porthole. There was a man on his doorstep. A thin man with wire-rim glasses and a ring of hair circling a bald dome.<br><i>Paul</i>.<br>David winced. He didn&#x2019;t want to see Paul. He didn&#x2019;t want to talk to Paul. It was Paul&#x2019;s fault that he wasn&#x2019;t able to grieve the way he sometimes felt he deserved&#x2014;in a penniless gutter with other heartbroken souls.<br>Paul Sheppard was his publisher, the man who had read David&#x2019;s proposal for a book based on notes left behind by convicted killer Ronil Brune and recognized a modicum of talent. Before <i>The Serial Killer&#x2019;s Prot�g�</i>, Paul had been an exclusively local publisher, the sort that shipped glossy copies of <i>Cleveland Steelworker Memories</i> and <i>Cleveland&#x2019;s Haunted History</i> to local indie bookstores. Today, he kept an office in Manhattan.<br>Reluctantly, David opened the door.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s alive!&#x201d; Paul shouted, raising his arms in the air like Dr. Frankenstein.<br>&#x201c;Shhhh! You&#x2019;ll wake the kid,&#x201d; he said. He motioned for Paul to come in.<br>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Stepping into the main room, Paul shook his head and whistled. &#x201c;I saw this documentary on Discovery the other day,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was about this woman who lives in Manhattan and she&#x2019;s this ridiculous pack rat and never throws anything away. She had this path carved out in clutter she could use to get to the bathroom and kitchen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; prodded David.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re like this far away from becoming that woman,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Her family had her committed, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re not my family, Paul,&#x201d; he said, smiling a little. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sit on that!&#x201d; He jumped to the recliner over which Paul was squatting and batted away yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Beacon Journal</i>. Underneath was a plastic dish that had once held a microwavable Salisbury steak dinner. David tossed it to the far corner of the room, where it landed next to a wastebasket. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting company.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I left you twenty messages. The only reason I knew you weren&#x2019;t dead is you keep depositing my checks.&#x201d;<br>Paul sat on the chair as David collapsed on the sofa, sending a mostly empty biggie-sized soda tumbling to the floor. &#x201c;It is nice to see you,&#x201d; David said sincerely. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s biz?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; said Paul, making a seesaw gesture. &#x201c;<i>Prot�g�</i> is still selling. I think half the universities in the country are teaching it in their journalism programs, so that helps it move every semester. I just signed this new up-and-comer from Pittsburgh, whose manuscript knocks me out.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a memoir, is it? Tell me it&#x2019;s not another memoir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In fact, it is a memoir. It&#x2019;s about an alcoholic steel smelter who went to prison for grand theft and, when he got out, cleaned himself up by slowly constructing a jet-powered semi truck in his garage. It wouldn&#x2019;t kill you to blurb it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is that why you came over?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; said Paul, a thin smile playing at one corner of his mouth. From his sports jacket pocket, the publisher pulled a bound galley of a book. He tossed it to David, who snatched it out of the air one-handed.<br>On the front was a grainy black-and-white picture of a grassy hill soaked in summer heat. Atop the hill sat a 1970s-era police cruiser, its driver&#x2019;s-side door ajar. Behind the car stretched a row of old-growth pine trees, gnarled branches like arthritic hands. David knew this photograph. He&#x2019;d discovered it, in fact, tucked into a box labeled MISCELLANEOUS in the Press archives at Cleveland State. It was a picture of a crime scene, an artifact of one of the many unsolved cases he&#x2019;d written about before he&#x2019;d become completely obsessed with Ronil Brune. The title of the book was <i>The Lesser Mysteries of Greater Cleveland</i>. At the bottom was David&#x2019;s name.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;Your next book,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just a mock-up, but I wanted you to see it, to feel the weight of it in your hands. It&#x2019;s a good cover, no?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great cover, Paul,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Only problem is, I didn&#x2019;t write this.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You did. It&#x2019;s twelve of your best true crime articles from your <i>Independent</i> days, Beverly Jarosz, Sam Sheppard, Lisa Pruett. I cleaned up the language and moved things around a bit here and there&#x2014;don&#x2019;t look at me like that, you were still learning dramatic narrative structure back then&#x2014;and I put them all together into this little trade paperback. Something for next summer&#x2019;s beach crowd, I&#x2019;m thinking. Something to tide everyone over until the next David Neff book.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need the money.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, either.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then why?&#x201d;<br>Paul glanced around the room, then back at David. &#x201c;I think you need something to remind you why you were ever a writer in the first place,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;A little New England collegiate lecture tour? Some free publicity in the trades? <i>Groupies?</i>&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True crime groupies are mostly middle-aged women who look like my high school home-ec teacher,&#x201d; said David. &#x201c;Nobody wants to buy a bunch of old stories. Anyone who wanted to read them has read them online already.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Paul, raising a finger. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not all reprints. Check out the table of contents.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;&#x2018;The Curious Case of the Man from Primrose Lane?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your next project,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the next mystery you&#x2019;re going to investigate, the new piece we&#x2019;ll use to market the book.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Man from Primrose Lane? Never heard of him. Who is he?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Geez, David. Don&#x2019;t you read the paper anymore?&#x201d; Paul regarded his friend silently for a moment, studying his features, perhaps to discern if there was any trace of the old David Neff in there someplace. &#x201c;You used to be the eternal optimist,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You thought you could solve <i>all</i> of these mysteries, remember?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d that work out?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you fucking blind?

Box 10703, Burke, VA 22009-0703.Phillips (Silent Night) is a new star on the historical romance horizon: she's literate, witty and tells a good story. As the title suggests, her inspiration's clearly Shakespearean, with a fast-paced plot that involves multiple exchanges of identity, disguises and a lively war between the sexes. Wealthy widow Lady Katherine Fitzhugh changes identities with her shy cousin Miranda, in order to better investigate Sir Brandon Cavendish, the mystery man King Henry VIII has chosen for her husband. Unbeknownst to Kat, however, handsome Sir Brandon, worried that his betrothed is an elderly witch who's already dispatched two husbands, has exchanged identities with his best friend, John Stafford, known at Henry's court as Jack of Hearts. Complicating what is already tangled is Kat's nephew and heir, a nasty piece of work who's determined to stop this wedding at all costs. Kat's really the focus here: a sanguine, determined survivor of two unfortunate marriages, she may occasionally be exasperated but isn't easily discouraged. The dialogue is fully and funnily Shakespearean, and while it may take a few pages to assimilate, it's a hoot. To tell more would spoil this wonderfully written comedy. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>For the King&#39;s Pleasure</h2><p>This pioneering study of one of the most lavish and costly interior decoration schemes ever carried out in England provides and unparalleled insight into George IV&#x2019;s patronage of the arts.

There&#x2019;s something we have to do today, but we are trying to postpone it. We need to go across the road to see Mr. Ewing; we need to ask for a valuation, and see what they think of our chances of selling. Ewing&#x2019;s is the local firm, and it was they who sold us the house, seven years ago. As the morning wears on we move around each other silently, avoiding conversation. The decision&#x2019;s made. There&#x2019;s no more to discuss.About eleven o&#x2019;clock, I see a flickering on the staircase. The air is still; then it moves. I raise my head. The air is still again. I know it is my stepfather&#x2019;s ghost coming down. Or, to put it in a way acceptable to most people, I &#x201c;know&#x201d; it is my stepfather&#x2019;s ghost.I am not perturbed. I am used to &#x201c;seeing&#x201d; things that aren&#x2019;t there. Or&#x2014;to put it in a way more acceptable to me&#x2014;I am used to seeing things that &#x201c;aren&#x2019;t there.&#x201d; It was in this house that I last saw my stepfather, Jack, in the early months of 1995: alive, in his garments of human flesh. Many times since then I have acknowledged him on the stairs.It may be, of course, that the flicker against the banister was nothing more than the warning of a migraine attack. It&#x2019;s at the left-hand side of my body that visions manifest; it&#x2019;s my left eye that is peeled. I don&#x2019;t know whether, at such vulnerable times, I see more than is there; or if things are there that normally I don&#x2019;t see.Over the years the premonitionary symptoms of migraine headaches have become more than the dangerous puzzle that they were earlier in my life, and more than a warning to take the drugs that might ward off a full-blown attack. They have become a psychic adornment or flourish, an art form, a secret talent I have never managed to make money from. Sometimes they take the form of the visual disturbances that are common to many sufferers. Small objects will vanish from my field of vision, and there will be floating lacunae in the world, each shaped rather like a doughnut with a dazzle of light where the hole should be. Sometimes there are flashes of gold against the wall: darting chevrons, like the wings of small quick angels. Scant sleep and lack of food increase the chances of these sightings; starving saints in Lent, hypoglycemic and jittery, saw visions to meet their expectations.Sometimes the aura takes more trying forms. I will go deaf. The words I try to write end up as other words. I will suffer strange dreams, from which I wake with hallucinations of taste. Once, thirty years ago, I dreamed that I was eating bees, and ever since I have lived with their milk-chocolate sweetness and their texture, which is like lightly cooked calves&#x2019; liver. It may be that a tune will lodge in my head like a tic and bring the words tripping in with it, so I am forced to live my life by its accompaniment. It&#x2019;s a familiar complaint, to have a tune you can&#x2019;t get out of your head. But for most people, the tunes aren&#x2019;t the preludeto a day of hearty vomiting. Besides, people say they pick them up from the radio, but mine are songs people don&#x2019;t really sing these days. Bill Bailey, won&#x2019;t you please come home? Some talk of Alexander, and some of Hercules. My aged father did me deny. And the name he gave me was the croppy boy.Today, the day I see the ghost, the problem&#x2019;s just that my words don&#x2019;t come out right. So I have to be careful, at Mr. Ewing&#x2019;s, but he understands me without any trouble, and yes, he remembers selling us the cottage, seven years ago, is it really so long? They were years in which perhaps half a million words were drafted and redrafted, seven and a half thousand meals were consumed, ten thousand painkillers (at a conservative estimate) were downed by me, and God knows how many by the people I&#x2019;d given a pain; years in which I got fatter and fatter (wider still and wider, shall my bounds be set): and during seven years of nights, dreams were dreamed, then erased or reformatted: they were years during which, on the eve of the publication of my seventh novel, my stepfather died. All my memories of him are bound up with houses, dreams of houses, real or dream houses with empty rooms waiting for occupation: with other people&#x2019;s stories, and other people&#x2019;s claims: with fright and my adult denial that I was frightened. But affection takes strange forms, after all. I can hardly bear to sell the cottage and leave him behind on the stairs.Late in the afternoon, a migrainous sleep steals up on me. It plants on my forehead a clammy ogre&#x2019;s kiss. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; I say, as the ogre sucks me into sleep. &#x201c;If the phone wakes, it will ring us.&#x201d; I knew the migraine was coming yesterday, when I stood in a Norfolk fishmonger choosing a meal for the cats. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;cod&#x2019;s too expensive just now to feed to fish. Even fish like ours.&#x201d;I hardly know how to write about myself. Any style you pick seems to unpick itself before a paragraph is done. I will just go for it, I think to myself, I&#x2019;ll hold out my hands and say, c&#x2019;est moi, get used to it. I&#x2019;ll trust the reader. This is what I recommend to people who ask me how to get published. Trust your reader, stop spoon-feeding your reader, stop patronizing your reader, give your reader credit for being as smart as you at least, and stop being so bloody beguiling: you in the back row, will you turn off that charm! Plain words on plain paper. Remember what Orwell says, that good prose is like a windowpane. Concentrate on sharpening your memory and peeling your sensibility. Cut every page you write by at least one third. Stop constructing those piffling little similes of yours. Work out what it is you want to say. Then say it in the most direct and vigorous way you can. Eat meat. Drink blood. Give up your social life and don&#x2019;t think you can have friends. Rise in the quiet hours of the night and prick your fingertips and use the blood for ink; that will cure you of persiflage!But do I take my own advice? Not a bit. Persiflage is my nom de guerre. (Don&#x2019;t use foreign expressions; it&#x2019;s elitist.) I stray away from the beaten path of plain words into the meadows of extravagant simile: angels, ogres, doughnut-shaped holes. And as for transparency&#x2014;windowpanes undressed are a sign of poverty, aren&#x2019;t they? How about some nice net curtains, so I can look out but you can&#x2019;t see in? How about shutters, or a chaste Roman blind? Besides, windowpane prose is no guarantee of truthfulness. Some deceptive sights are seen through glass, and the best liars tell lies in plain words.So now that I come to write a memoir, I argue with myself over every word. Is my writing clear: or is it deceptively clear?I tell myself, just say how you came to sell a house with a ghost in it. But this story can be told only once, and I need to get it right. Why does the act of writing generate so much anxiety? Margaret Atwood says, &#x201c;The written word is so much like evidence&#x2014;like something that can be used against you.&#x201d; I used to think that autobiography was a form of weakness, and perhaps I still do. But I also think that, if you&#x2019;re weak, it&#x2019;s childish to pretend to be strong.Sell Owl: the decision came with us, crawling through the Friday evening traffic on the M25, and navigating the darkness of Breckland settlements with their twisted pines and shuttered houses. We had done this journey so many times, looping past the center of Norwich on the fringes of industrial estates, slowing at the crossroads among West Earlham council houses: lamps burning behind drawn curtains, no one in the streets. As you cross the city boundary the streetlights run out, the road narrows. You creep forward into that darkness which is lit only by the glittering eyes of foxes and farm cats, punctuated by the flurry of wing beats and scurrying of busy feet in the verges. Something unseen is eating. Something is being consumed.As you enter the small town of Reepham you turn by the church wall, bashed and battered by many long vehicles, into the marketplace empty of cars. The King&#x2019;s Arms is still burning a light, the big doors of the Old Brewery are closed and its residents padding upward to their beds. Turning uphill from the square, you park on the muddy rutted ground at the back of the cottage, unloading in the dark and mostly in the rain; your boots know the puddles and slippery patches, the single dark step and the paving&#x2019;s edge. Sometimes it is midnight and winter, the cold sucking the virtue from a torch beam, diffusing the lightinto an aimless dazzle. But just as feet know the path, fingers know the keys. Fifty yards from the Market Place, there is no light pollution, no urban backwash to pale the sky; no flight path, no footfall. There is starlight, frost on the path, and owls crying from three parishes.You sleep well in this house, though if you are here on a weekday morning the trucks and tractors wake you at dawn. Their exudates plaster the roadside windows with a greasy, smearing dirt. The country is not clean or quiet. Through the day hydraulic brakes wheeze as truck drivers come to a halt at the bottom of the hill, at Townsend Corner. But when they say town&#x2019;s end, they mean it. Beyond the police station, beyond the last bungalow&#x2014;that is to say, in less than a quarter of a mile&#x2014;the town becomes open fields. The next settlement is Kerdiston. Its church fell down several hundred years ago. It has no street names and indeed, no streets. Even the people who live there aren&#x2019;t sure where it is. Its single distinguished resident, Sir William de Kerdeston, moved to Reepham after he died, and lies in effigy on his tomb, resting&#x2014;if that is the word&#x2014;in full armor and on a bed of pebbles: his shoulder muscles twitching, perhaps, his legs flexing, every year as we reach the Feast of All Souls and the dead prepare to walk.When we bought the cottage it had no name or history. It was a conversion of buildings that might once have been a house, or not; most likely it was some kind of agricultural storeroom. At some point early in the 1990s, a Norwich builder knocked four flats and two cottages out of its undistinguished structure of old red-brown brick.In the winter of 1992-93 we were scouring the county for a weekend place. We went to the coast and deep into the heartland, always keeping in mind the long journey from Berkshireand our need to settle, for weekends, close to my parents, who had retired to Holt. Studded into our Barbour raingear, driving our scarlet BMW, we were a sight to gladden the eyes of any country estate agent. We would see their faces light up, only to assume their habitual gray glaze when we introduced them to our stringent budget and our high requirements. We wanted nothing tumbledown, nothing picturesque, nothing with a small but containable dry rot problem. And nothing too remote, as I might want to stay there alone, and I am myself too remote and nervous and irritable to drive a car. We wanted a shop and a pub, but most Norfolk villages are straggling depopulated hamlets, with a telephone box, if you&#x2019;re lucky, to mark their center. All the same, we thought there was a home for us somewhere in the county. I&#x2019;d just won a book prize, so we had unexpected cash to pitch in. Norfolk wasn&#x2019;t fashionable then. People thought it was too far from London, and it didn&#x2019;t have what urbanites require, the infrastructure of gourmet dining and darling little delis; it had pubs that served microwaved baked potatoes with huge glum portions of gravy and meat, and small branches of Woolworth in small towns, and Spar groceries in larger villages, and waterbirds, and long reaches of shingle and sea, and a vast expanse of painter&#x2019;s sky.By this stage we knew Norfolk fairly well. I had first come to the county in 1980, to stay with friends who were themselves newly settled in a Broadlands village. My own home was in Africa, but my marriage was breaking up. A wan child with a suitcase&#x2014;an old child, at twenty-eight&#x2014;I went about to visit people, to stay for a while and drift away again, ending up always back at my parental home, which was then still in the north. I seemed to be perpetually on trains, dragging my luggage up flights of steps at Crewe, or trying to find a sheltered place on the windswept platforms of Nuneaton. As I traveled, I grew thinner and thinner, more frayed and shabby, more lonely. I was homesick for the house I had left, for my animals, for the manuscript of the vast novel I had written and left behind. I was homesick for my husband, but my feelings about my past were too impenetrable and misty for me to grasp, and to keep them that way I often began and ended each day with a sprinkling of barbiturates gulped from my palm, washed down with the water from some other household&#x2019;s cup. When you take barbiturates at night your dreams are blank and black, and your awakening is sick and distant, the day in front of you like a shoreline glimpsed from a pitching ship. But this is because you need some more. After an hour, you feel just fine.My Norfolk host was a woman I had known in Africa. Her husband was working abroad again, and she didn&#x2019;t like to be alone in the country dark. If our strained expatriate lives had not brought us into contact, we would never have been friends; after a while I realized we weren&#x2019;t friends anyway, so I got on a train in Norwich and never came back. But our long drives about the county, lost in winter lanes, our limp salads in village caf�s, our scramblings in overgrown churchyards, and our attention to the stories of old people had made me think deeply about this territory, and want to write a novel set there. After some years, this was what I did.We had been separated for no more than two years when my ex-husband came to England, changed. I believe people do change; there&#x2019;s no mileage, really, in believing the opposite. I also had changed. I was living alone. I was sick with a chronic illness, swollen by steroid medication, and a cynic in matters of romance. Of Freud&#x2019;s two constants, love and work, I now embraced just one; I was employed six days a week at two illpaid jobs, days in a bookshop and nights behind a bar, and I got up at dawn to write my journals and stabilize my body for a venture into the world. I kept notes for future books; at that time, 1982, I had published only one short story. I had given up barbiturates. I don&#x2019;t remember exactly when I stopped, or what I did with the endless supply of tiny pills from the big plastic tub I&#x2019;d brought from Africa. Did I tail them off? Stop them cold? I don&#x2019;t know. In view of the claims I will later make for my memory, this causes me concern. Perhaps they brought their own oblivion with them, each rattling little scoop of pinheadsized killers. Since then I have always been addicted to something or other, usually something there&#x2019;s no support group for. Semicolons, for instance, I can never give up for more than two hundred words at a time.Whether I was fit, that summer, to make a rational decision&#x2014;well, who ever knows about that? It seemed that what I had left, with my ex-husband, was more than most people started with. So we got married again, economically, at the registrar&#x2019;s office in Maidenhead, with two witnesses. It was September, and I felt very ill that morning, queasy and swollen, as if I were pregnant; there was a pain behind my diaphragm, and from time to time something seemed to flip over and claw at me, as if I were a woman in a folktale, pregnant with a demon. Nothing, except for having to get married, would have got me out of bed, into my dress, into my high heels, and into the street. The registrar was kindly, and wished us better luck this time around. There was no ring; as the size of my fingers was changing week to week, I didn&#x2019;t see the point, and it is possible, also, that I didn&#x2019;t want to ...</p><h2>The Last Flower - A Parable in Pictures</h2><p>Originally published in November 1939, two months after World War II officially began, James Thurber's parable in pictures-- a graphic novel ahead of its day--about eternal cycles of war, peace, love, and the resilience of one little flower remains as relevant today as it was then. <i>The New York Times </i>called it "at once one of the most serious and one of the most hilarious contributions on war."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civilization has collapsed&nbsp; after World War XII, dogs have deserted their masters, all the groves and gardens have been destroyed, and love has vanished from the earth.

Experts who do are just lucky and are usually expert only at selling their services (as they hyperactively trade your portfolio to maximize fees).

Solin's message is helped immensely by the businesslike, easy-to-hear narration of Craig Wollman, Though Solin recognizes the skill of stock-picking geniuses like Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett, his argument is that most individual investing experts are not that smart and are not to be trusted if they say they are.

Within seven years of the onset of a fungus that wiped out Ireland's staple potato crop, more than a quarter of the country's eight million people had either starved to death, died of disease, or emigrated to other lands. Photographs have documented the horrors of other cataclysmic times in history -- slavery and the Holocaust -- but there are no known photographs whatsoever of the Great Hunger. <p> In <i>Feed the Children First,</i> Mary E. Lyons combines first-person accounts of those who remembered the Great Hunger with artwork that evokes the times and places and voices themselves. The result is a close-up look at incredible suffering, but also a celebration of joy the Irish took in stories and music and helping one another -- all factors that helped them endure.</p></p><p><b>Mary E. Lyons</b> is the author of many books for children and young adults, including <i>Roy Makes a Car, Feed the Children First, Dear Ellen Bee, Letters from a Slave Girl</i>, and <i>Sorrow's Kitchen</i>. In addition to the Golden Kite Award and a <i>Horn Book</i> Fanfare for <i>Letters from a Slave Girl</i>, Lyons was also the recipient of a 2005 Aesop Award for <i>Roy Makes a Car</i> and a Carter G. Woodson Award for <i>Sorrow's Kitchen</i>. A teacher and former librarian, she lives in Charlottesville, Virginia. You can learn more about her at www.lyonsdenbooks.com.Grades 4-8--This beautifully crafted work combines first-person accounts of Ireland's potato famine, the Great Hunger of 1845-1852, with artwork that recalls those times. Following a concise, informative introduction, the brief selections speak of the people and the land before the Great Hunger, the potato blight and subsequent starvation and illness, the poorhouse, soup kitchens, relief works, eviction, and emigration. They bear witness not only to unbearable suffering, but also to the humanity, dignity, and endurance of a people. Almost all are Irish voices, stories handed down through the families of survivors. Although no photographs of the Great Hunger exist, Irish newspapermen traveling through the country made sketches, and painters later used the theme; full-color reproductions of many are perfectly paired with the selections, as are a few photographs from a later famine. The attractive layout makes effective use of white space. The whole is a fine accompaniment to Susan Campbell Bartoletti's Black Potatoes (Houghton, 2001) and Patricia Reilly Giff's novel, Nory Ryan's Song (Delacorte, 2000), as well as powerful testimony to the suffering of famine victims worldwide.<br><i>Diane S.

Waves slapped the hoar-frosted hulls of ships snugged against ice-cloaked piers. The gale moaned through the furled rigging, sang in the taut lines, and whispered past the red-brick buildings facing the waterfront. It whipped down the cobblestone streets in eddying gusts that twirled faded bits of paper and soot-speckled snow across patches of dirty ice. The hanging signs swayed and creaked forlornly over firmly latched oaken doors.Driven by the wind, the terrible chill ate through wraps and woolens until a man's bones ached, and a deep breath seared the lungs. The few courageous pedestrians shivered as they hurried along Boston's slick and winding streets. They scuttled forward, bent into the wind, coats hugged tightly about them, lost in thoughts of warm fireplaces and cheery stoves. Exposed flesh prickled as the relentless blowtore frosty breath from nose or mouth to hustle it away into the gray afternoon.The freezing wind bulled across the Commons to rattle the paned windows of an imposing house. It surged against the firm brick walls, twisted at the gables, and wormed around the fretwork and trim; but the house stood as solidly as the stout man poised behind the quivering second-story windows.Like a master at the wheel of his ship, Phillip Hamilton had his feet braced, hands clasped behind him. A black cummerbund graced his thickened waist and snugged the crisp white shirt. A full-cut coat hung from his shoulders. Once so broad, they had bowed with age.His rough-hewn face looked bulldoggish. The stubby nose might have been mashed onto the thick cheeks. Lines strained the pale skin around his clamped mouth as though he were enduring pain, and hard gray eyes glared out at the world from under grizzled brows. His brown hair was shot through with silver now, and pulled back into a severe ponytail--archaic, given the fashions of the time.Phillip Hamilton lifted his chin as he caught sight of the figure that rounded a far corner, glanced back and forth, and started irresolutely across the track-dimpled Commons. Against the powdery white background, the young man seemed to be a wavering apparition, hardly human in form. He progressed in halting, uncertain steps, peeking at the house as if he could sense Phillip's hard gaze.<i>Is there nothing of me in him?</i>Richard John Charles Hamilton--Phillip Hamilton's only son--shuffled his way through the drifted snow. From Phillip's window he looked as if he were taking an absurd pleasure in the agony of his cold feet and the needling sting on his half-frozen face.Phillip rocked on his feet, frustration wrapping around his heart. Damn it, just once couldn't the boy act like a man? Walk with pride in his step, head back?<i>Not when he understands what is about to happen. Surely he must know why I've sent for him.</i>Phillip snorted, fortifying himself. Dealing with will-o'-the-wisp Richard always agitated him, set his stomach tochurning. God's blood, if the boy didn't grovel so, maybe it wouldn't be so tempting to grind him down. A little backbone, that's all it would take.<i>My fault ... all my fault.</i>Richard stamped snow from his feet as he stepped onto Beacon Street. He thrust balled fists deeper into his coat and kicked at a pile of frozen horse manure.<i>Come on, boy. Let's get it over. It's just as hard for me as it will be for you.</i>The trees on the Commons formed a black lace of branches, stark against the sullen gray-white sky. Occasional crystals of ice drifted down, dancing in the numbing wind. Richard raised his apprehensive gaze to his father's red-brick house.Phillip instinctively stepped back into the shadows. To either side of the bulging bay windows hung the Belgian lace curtains Phillip's wife had once delighted in.Thoughts of her touched that deep-seated callus of anxiety and grief. <i>I should have been there for Caroline.</i> His eyes narrowed as he watched the boy. <i>And for him.</i>He'd been at sea when Caroline bore Richard. During the following weeks when her life ebbed slowly out of her body, Phillip had been in Paris, Madrid, and Amsterdam, negotiating the agreements that would make his fortune.<i>What God gives with one hand, He takes with the other.</i> A triumphant Phillip Hamilton had returned to his house one week to the day after his wife's death. And, there, had encountered the end of his dreams--and an infant son lying in a wet nurse's arms.Phillip craned his neck to see the street below.Richard had slowed to a stop in the center of the street, and his thin body erupted in shivers. With a mittened hand, he reached up to brush a loose strand of honey brown hair from his sensitive brown eyes.<i>Caroline's eyes. You can see so much of her in him. But where is that spark of daring and courage? How could he have so many of her looks, but so little of her spirit?</i>Richard had received his father's summons that morning. Jeffry, Phillip's household servant, had described the young man crouched by the tiny tin stove in his rented room, cocoonedin threadbare blankets, studying a new translation of Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of Mind.</i>Phenomenology of mind? What kind of idiocy could <i>that</i> be?Upon sight of Jeffry, the boy had gone pale, his hand trembling as he broke the wax seal and read the note. Phillip's perfectly formed letters stated: <i>Richard, I need to see you immediately to discuss your situation. A carriage is waiting for you downstairs.</i>For long moments Richard had stared glumly through the panes of his little window, the sill delicately mantled with snow.Jeffry had reported him as saying, "I can't come now. Not now. I--I'm feeling poorly."In his preoccupation, he had accidentally kicked over the clutter of empty wine and ale bottles amassed along one wall. They had rolled across the slanted floor in a tinkling racket."Your father's carriage is downstairs." Jeffry had that cold, precise nature about him. Phillip could imagine him, standing tall, black face as graven as solid walnut."I have errands," Richard had stated, and Phillip could imagine the tremor in the young man's voice. "I'll be there as soon as I can. Tell him ... tell him at one. I'll be there at one."Jeffry had inclined his head, taken his leave, and reported back. Phillip needn't glance at the old ship's clock to tell that it now lacked fifteen minutes of two. And there the boy stood, shivering in the snow, trying to muster the guts to knock at his father's door.So, where had the boy been? That student's hideout, no doubt: Fenno's Tavern on Washington Street. Was that it? Did young Richard need a stiff shot of whiskey just to face his father?<i>I've failed ... failed miserably.</i> From the shadows behind the lace curtains, Phillip watched his son close his eyes, breath puffing before his thin face. He'd be a handsome young man were there a little color to his cheeks, a little meat to his shoulders and arms. The high brow, the thin nose, both spoke of aristocracy and privilege--of everythingPhillip Hamilton could never have been or had were he not American.Apparently, Richard nerved himself. One by one he climbed the steps and reached for the ornate knocker on the heavy door.The hollow sound carried to Phillip's second-story study.They had fought this same battle many times before. Richard, for all his talk of philosophy, freedom, and natural law, clung desperately to the umbilical cord of Phillip's purse. It seemed that one could not be a philosopher unless one had a wealthy father to support the luxury.Today, however, Richard's luxury was coming to an end.<i>Rousseau ... yes, Rousseau.</i> Richard liked to imagine himself as a man in the state of nature, possessed only of virtue and happiness. What had the boy said that day? Yes ... "Father, you have embraced all the curses of civilization: property, money, power, greed, and the corruption of the soul that led one man to place another in bondage."And he'd had the audacity to say that at the very instant that Jeffry was ladling soup into Richard's silver bowl!"Father, you find no study more fascinating than a ledger page. All you do is hunch at your cherrywood desk, peering at your books by the light of an oil lamp. You call that life? Balancing figures over and over again?"<i>Yes, boy. Those figures keep your belly full, and buy your books. Or, at least, they have up until now.</i>The younger Hamilton claimed that civilization had fallen from God's natural grace.<i>Well, boy, you may have God's grace. Unfortunately, today you'll have to deal with mine.</i>The heavy door downstairs closed with finality.Phillip sighed, hitched around on his good leg, and stumped across the ornate parlor. After the death of his wife, Phillip had practically lived here, behind the cherrywood desk, surrounded by his fortress of ledgers. Here he'd made war on the markets with tobacco, rum, slaves, lace, tinware, porcelain, muskets, glassware, tea, and all the other things that ebbed and flowed in the international trade. He'd lost ships and crews to hurricanes, icebergs, pirates, disease, and impressment. He'd battled tariffs, interest, and insurancewith the same fiery spirit that he'd once shown the British. Just over there, across the bay at Breed's Hill.He stepped into the gracious hallway, bracing himself on the handrail as he walked to the head of the stairs. Plush carpets lay underfoot, carried here from the Ottoman Empire. Walnut wainscoting rose to white-plastered walls. The giant brass-mounted ship's clock tick-a-tocked monotonously where it hung next to the oak-banistered stairway that led downstairs. Phillip stopped at the head of the stairs, looking down at the first-floor landing. To the left, a double doorway led into the office where he met with his agents and factors. To the right sat the hall chair with its tall mirrored back, and beyond that the French doors which led into the dining room.Jeffry stood between Richard and the door, a hand extended as he asked, "May I take your hat and coat, Master Richard?"Richard pulled off his frost-crusted hat, baring his light brown hair. His shabby black coat hung loosely on his skinny frame. The boy wasn't eating right again; his normally pale complexion looked death-pasty in the dim light.Jeffry stepped away, bearing his tattered prizes to the cloakroom with stately grace."Richard? You're late." Phillip struggled to keep his voice from turning gruff. "I suppose philosophers don't pay much attention to time. One o'clock is just about as good as two, wouldn't you say?""Yes, sir. I--I mean ... no, sir." Richard lowered his eyes.Damn it, did the boy always have to look like a whipped puppy? "Join me in the study, Richard."Resigned, Richard climbed, eyes focused on his wet boots. They left droplets on the walnut steps. At the head of the stairs, he sought to muster a smile that died stillborn.Phillip could hear Richard's nervous breath rasping in his throat as he gestured the boy through the doorway. Phillip hesitated, fingers on the cool oaken door. Richard jumped when the door closed solidly behind them.Phillip sighed and limped toward his ornately carved desk and its neat piles of papers. The fireplace popped and crackled,the brass wood bin beside it half-full. Books covered one wall from floor to ceiling. From the bulging bay window behind Phillip, the Charles River could be seen, ice-choked now, the water pewter in the afternoon light. Two whale-oil-filled glass lamps, one to either side, illuminated the desk. A crimson Persian carpet cushioned the floor. In one corner sat a globe, and behind it, the Charleville musket, powder horn, and bullet pouch Phillip had carried in the Revolution.Phillip reached the overstuffed French chair and, with effort, lowered himself behind the huge desk. Here he was in his element, everything in place: the quills in their stand; the ink in its well; a solitary copper button he'd ripped from the scarlet jacket of a British officer he'd killed at Breed's Hill; and beside the left-hand lamp, his ledgers. Finally, his wife's heavy leather-bound Bible lay just at the extent of his reach to the right. He sighed before pulling some papers from a stack. Thick fingers pinched his glasses onto his nose.Richard remained standing. From the way his long fingers crumpled his stained black trousers, panic was fraying the last of his composure."Now then," Phillip began. "I have here a list of expenditures accumulated for the last four months at the university. If I do say so, you have already spent more than enough time at Harvard." He glanced up over the rims of his spectacles. "Not to mention money."Richard wet his lips. "Father, I have more studies. I <i>must</i> continue my education!""Why, Richard?" Phillip asked woodenly. "I see no progress in your work. I pointedly refer to progress in useful studies ... those which will prepare you to deal with our modern world. At this point you have all the education required of a gentleman. You know the Classics, speak Latin and Greek as well as French, German, and a smattering of Portuguese. What more does a gentleman need?" Phillip spread his hands. "To what earthly use will you put this 'philosophy' of yours?""To become a professor, Father." He knotted his thin white fingers into bony fists."A <i>professor</i>? When I sent you to the university, it was to learn about the world so that you could take a position here, with me. I can't run the company forever, Richard. You have responsibilities to me, to society. And by that, I mean <i>American</i> society. I refuse to treat you like a child any longer." Phillip paused as he picked up a quill and rolled it between his fingers. "Nevertheless, I shan't be accused of denying you a defense. Tell me ... what have you learned?""I--I've learned a lot. I just ...just don't think you would ... well ... understand, sir. That's all."Phillip tightened the corners of his mouth. "I see. A matter of understanding. Very well, I confess to be a man of open mind. Tell me something of the nature of man. I've heard you use that term. Let me hear it ... and how it will put bread and meat on your table. Let me hear how it will keep a roof over your head."Richard took a deep breath and locked his knees to keep from trembling. Did he act this way standing before Professor Ames? Were that the case, they should have throw...</p><h2>Vrindaban Days: Memories of an Indian Holy Town</h2><p>Great read.</p><p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Tangle!

Philipp Ther provides needed perspective on today&#x2019;s &#x201c;refugee crisis,&#x201d; demonstrating how Europe has taken in far greater numbers of refugees in earlier periods of its history, in wartime as well as peacetime. His sweeping narrative crosses the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, taking readers from the Middle East to the shores of America.</p><p>In this compelling book, Ther examines the major causes of mass flight, from religious intolerance and ethnic cleansing to political persecution and war. He describes the perils and traumas of flight and explains why refugees and asylum seekers have been welcomed in some periods&#x2015;such as during the Cold War&#x2015;and why they are rejected in times such as our own. He also examines the afterlives of the refugees in the receiving countries, which almost always benefited from admitting them. Tracing the lengthy routes of the refugees, he reconceptualizes Europe as a unit of geography and historiography. Turning to the history of refugees in the United States, Ther also discusses the anti-refugee politics of the Trump administration, explaining why they are un-American and bad for the country.</p><p>By setting mass flight against fifteen biographical case studies, and drawing on his subjects&#x2019; experiences, itineraries, and personal convictions, Ther puts a human face on a global phenomenon that concerns all of us.</p></p><p><b>Philipp Ther</b> is professor of Central European history at the University of Vienna. His books include <i>Europe since 1989: A History</i> (Princeton), <i>The Dark Side of Nation-States: Ethnic Cleansing in Modern Europe</i>, and <i>Center Stage: Operatic Culture and Nation Building in Nineteenth-Century Central Europe</i>. He lives in Vienna."A stimulating and informative read. <i>The Outsiders</i> is probably the most complete story of population movements in Europe's modern era ever written."<b>--John Connelly, author of <i>From Enemy to Brother: The Revolution in Catholic Teaching on the Jews, 1933-1965</i></b><br><br>"This is a brilliant and important book that takes the current European refugee crisis as a point of departure for exploring the longer history of refugees to and from Europe. <i>The Outsiders</i> is highly original in its approach to contemporary history and exceptionally valuable in its historical treatment of the refugee phenomenon."<b>--Larry Wolff, author of <i>The Singing Turk </i></b><br><br>"Ther's book is indispensable reading for anybody interested in the history of flight and migration in Europe. It also confirms how important a<i> longue dur�e </i>approach is to understanding all the recent conflicts surrounding refugee politics. Once more, Ther has managed to write a Pan-European book, although the specter extends far beyond, across the Atlantic and the Mediterranean."<b>--Wlodzimierz Borodziej, author of <i>The Warsaw Uprising of 1944</i></b><br><br>"Philipp Ther has written a comprehensive and humane history essential for understanding what has become the most divisive issue in European and American politics today--the claims of the millions of refugees uprooted from their homelands and seeking sanctuary across borders. From the Spanish expulsions of 1492 to the crisis in Syria today, <i>The Outsiders</i> sheds light on why refugees fled and the contradictory policies with which they were greeted."<b>--Charles S. Maier, author of <i>Once within Borders: Territories of Power, Wealth, and Belonging since 1500</i></b><br><br>"Providing needed perspective on an issue that looms large on the global agenda, Philipp Ther's engaging book is the definitive historical account of the legal, demographic, and humanitarian aspects of refugee crises in Europe over the course of five hundred years."<b>--Maria Todorova, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</b></p><h2>Artificial Lures</h2><p>158 pages with tips and detailed instructions on how to make Artificial Lures in full color.</p><p></p><h2>Thomas Hardy: The Guarded Life</h2><p>Internationally renowned as the author of <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i>, <i>Tess of the D&#x2019;Urbervilles</i>, <i>Jude the Obscure, Wessex Poems and Other Verses</i>, and <i>Winter Words</i>, Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) nonetheless remains an elusive and enigmatic figure. His own diligent efforts to guard his privacy making bonfires of his papers, ghost-writing his own biography to be published after his death have obscured many aspects of the author&#x2019;s personal life. This book, the first major biography of Hardy in decades, draws on new and extensive archival research to present a more complex picture of Hardy than has been possible to date.<br>Author Ralph Pite investigates the validity of long-accepted views of the author: Was his early life devoted to his preparation for becoming a writer? Did his first wife, Emma, trick him into an unwanted marriage? Was his poetry far dearer to his heart than the novels? And was Florence, his second wife, as conflicted and passionate as caricatures have suggested? Pite examines the relationships and contexts that shaped Hardy most the women in his life, his friends and mentors, social and family pressures, career structures of his day, the Devonshire landscape and offers new insight into the man who, until now, was hidden behind an opaque public image he helped to create.</p><p><b>Ralph Pite</b> is professor of English at Cardiff University, Wales. His previous books include <i>The Circle of Our Vision: Dante&#x2019;s Presence in English Romantic Poetry</i>, and <i>Hardy&#x2019;s Geography: Wessex and the Regional Novel</i>.*Starred Review* Pite bases this revisionist biography of Hardy on his reinterpretation of the novelist's autobiographical <i>Life</i>. Widely regarded as a work of candor, Hardy's <i>Life </i>turns out be an artful fiction. As deftly as he created Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Clym Yeobright, and other characters, Hardy turned his autobiographical self into a dignified stoic, born to be a great poet, so denying his readers access to the tempestuous realities of his formative years. Through careful research and close readings of Hardy's work, Pite recovers the psychological confusion that Hardy sought--with astonishing success--to keep out of the public eye. Pite reveals, for instance, that the youthful rejection of Christianity that Hardy depicts in his <i>Life </i>as the foregone conclusion of a tough-minded intellect was actually an emotionally wrenching process. Similarly, whereas the Hardy of the <i>Life </i>responds to hostile criticism with philosophical detachment, the real Hardy recoiled into self-doubt. The maturing writer whom Pite exposes looks quite unlike the godlike sage of the <i>Life</i>, yet Hardy's own novels and poetry foster compassion for the painfully fractured personality Hardy tried to mask. A valuable complement to Tomalin's 2006 life of Hardy: Tomalin illuminating the hard-won authorial poise of Hardy's late verse, Pite plumbing the long-hidden tempests of the younger soul. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This exciting sequel picks up with Claire moving back to Stoney Creek to work as a family physician and help her mother care for her disabled father. She rekindles her relationship with John Serelli and&#x2015;just before she&#x2019;s going to find out if she carries the HD gene&#x2015;discovers an engagement ring hidden in his car. When John fails to &#x201c;pop the question&#x201d; before learning the results of the test, Claire believes he is only interested in marrying her if she does not have the HD gene. She runs away from him without learning the results of the test, or the strength of his love.Claire copes with her romantic disappointment by plunging into her work. But a brutal rapist attacks three of Claire&#x2019;s patients, just as each young woman is recovering from a recent accident or surgery. When Claire has surgery for appendicitis, she herself is attacked. Only her trust in God can keep Claire safe.</p><p>Harry Lee Kraus, MD, (www.cuttingedgefiction.com) is the bestselling author of ten books, including Could I Have This Dance? For the Rest of My Life, and All I&#x2019;ll Ever Need. He draws from his career as a board-certified general surgeon to flavor his writing with exceptional authenticity and technical knowledge. He and his wife, Kris, are missionaries serving in East Africa.In Could I Have This Dance?, board-certified general surgeon Kraus spun the inspirational tale of a physician who uncovered an undiagnosed pocket of Huntington's disease ("HD," or "the dance") in her hometown and in her own family. Here, Kraus picks up the story of Claire McCall, M.D., as she awaits the outcome of her own genetic testing for HD. As Claire and her mother care for her father, who is in the advanced and desperately debilitating stages of the disease, she decides to postpone knowing whether she has it. Claire is in love with John Cerelli and afraid of what the results of the test might mean for their future. Her concern about the strength of John's love for her takes a sudden turn, however, when a serial rapist begins victimizing her patients, and John falls under suspicion. Does she know him as well as she thought? And where is God in all of this? The reader will have to suspend disbelief in places to enjoy the story, including a scene where John throws away an expensive diamond ring and it finds its way to a new owner in an unlikely manner. The author's practical experience as a doctor lends authenticity to the plot and results in some detailed descriptions of medical conditions and of the postrape examination of victims (which may be a bit graphic for the novel's intended Christian audience). Brisk pacing keeps the pages turning, and fans of the first novel will enjoy discovering how the romance between Claire and John reaches a surprising conclusion. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Scientific Illustration: A Guide to Biological, Zoological, and Medical Rendering Techniques, Design, Printing and Display</h2><p><p><b>A complete guide to medical and scientific illustration</b></p> <p><i>Scientific Illustration: A Guide to Biological, Zoological, and Medical Rendering Techniques, Design, Printing, and Display</i> provides comprehensive guidance toward creating graphics that meet the rigorous needs of the scientific community.

The mountain rose sharply, as symmetrical and uncomplicated as a child&#x2019;s drawing. The sky above was midwinter blue. At home in England they would be expecting snow at this time in December, but here, so close to Sicily, the wind off the salt water was mild. The small boat barely rocked.<br><br>He had been looking forward to this break from the reality of London, work and the routine of his life, which lately had seemed more meaningless than ever. The recent death of his wife had given him an acute feeling of loss, but not in the way he had expected. There was no deep ache of bereavement. It forced him to realize that perhaps he had felt alone for a long time.<br><br>Would three weeks on Stromboli, a volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian, accomplish anything, change anything inside him? Would it heal the sense of helplessness, the bitterness of endless small failures? Maybe. It would certainly give him a long time to think, uninterrupted by the petty details of life.<br><br>He was in his midforties, yet he felt old.<br><br>They were almost at the shore. He could see men on the wharfs busy unloading fishing boats. There were small houses along the front, and streets leading inland, climbing quite steeply. It all looked simple and homely, probably much as it had done for two thousand years or more.<br><br>The mountain was bigger than it had seemed at a distance. It towered above them, almost bare of vegetation except for patches of grass. The terrain looked smooth, even gentle from here.<br><br>It was time to pay attention to landing. The boat was only feet away from the wharf edge. Ropes were tossed and made fast. A man shouted in broken English for Charles to get out, to hold on so he didn&#x2019;t slip. They were all cheerful, smiling to make up for the words they didn&#x2019;t know.<br><br>Charles thanked the men in polite English, and accepted a steadying hand so as not to fall on the wet stones. He should make an effort to learn a little Italian. It would be a courtesy.<br><br>Someone passed him up his case. He had brought only the necessities: a minimum of clothes, a pair of boots, toiletries, and a couple of books. His intention was to spend his time walking as much as possible.<br><br>He knew that the hostelry where he was staying was quite remote and a long way from the port village&#x2014;�too far to walk with a case&#x2014;�so he hired a pony cart and driver to take him up the side of the mountain.<br><br>It was a pleasant ride, although the rough roads were quite steep in places. As they moved away from the water&#x2019;s edge, Charles realized that the landscape was actually far more varied than he had thought. The central cone of the volcano was not as symmetrical as it had seemed from below, at sea. It towered above them, bare toward the top, as if shorn of its grass and shrubs. Yet it had a kind of beauty that was brave but also almost barbaric.<br><br>His driver nodded. &#x201c;She sleep now,&#x201d; he said, showing gaps in his teeth as he smiled. &#x201c;She wake up. You see.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles thought that he would rather not, but it would be impolite to say so. They were passing through rolling grassy country now. He imagined that in the spring and summer it would be full of flowers and butterflies, probably bees. A good place to walk.<br><br>They passed a few small settlements, some of whose narrow streets were cobbled, others, merely dry earth. The limestone houses were whitewashed. They looked as if they had been there forever. Women were busy with picking herbs or gathering in laundry. Children played, running and hiding, fighting with sticks for swords. Old men stood by a fountain on the street corner and stopped their conversation long enough to look briefly at the passersby.<br><br>As they drove, the driver gave commentary Charles did not understand, though he smiled and nodded at suitable intervals. He was relieved when they finally arrived at the low, rambling house well beyond the villages that was to be his home for the next three weeks.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said as the man handed him his case. He paid the agreed amount and, as the pony and cart set off back toward the shore, he turned to look for his host.<br><br>The low midwinter sun cast a warm light on the stone house, slight shadows hiding blemishes and giving it an infinitely comforting look.<br><br>Then a man came out of the door and hurried toward him, a broad smile on his face, his hand held out.<br><br>&#x201c;I am Stefano,&#x201d; he said cheerfully. &#x201c;You must be Signor Latterly, yes? Good. Welcome to Stromboli. Is beautiful, yes?&#x201d; He waved his arm in a broad sweep to include the huge, looming mountain and the arch of the sky, which was already darkening in the east. The fire of sunset in the west was painting the sea with color. A faint wind stirred, carrying the scent of the grasses.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it is,&#x201d; Charles said quickly. &#x201c;I look forward to exploring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; Stefano agreed. &#x201c;You have come a long way. Now you are tired. You eat. I have something for you. I show you your room. Yes? Come.&#x201d; Without waiting for Charles to reply, he led the way past the front of the house, along a small passage between buildings, and out into a courtyard with a bubbling fountain in it.<br><br>Charles had no time to look at it or admire the stone fish that formed its base. Stefano briskly led him into another open-�air passage at the far side of the courtyard and opened the second door along.<br><br>&#x201c;This is your room,&#x201d; he said with a flourish. &#x201c;You are welcome. Kitchen is that way.&#x201d; He pointed. &#x201c;Come when you are ready. I make you something to eat, yes?&#x201d; He patted his ample stomach. &#x201c;Nobody sleep well empty. Not good. I look after you, you leave Stromboli a new man!&#x201d; He smiled widely. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes . . . yes, please,&#x201d; Charles accepted, walking past Stefano and inside. He set his case down, staring around him. The room was small, containing a bed, a table and chair, and a washstand. There was also one chest of drawers and a makeshift closet composed of several hooks behind a curtain. The floor was tiled in a warm earth shade. There was a bathroom through a small door, to be shared with his immediate neighbor. He did not care for that, but it was acceptable. It was all immaculately clean. The cool air through the open window smelled of dry earth.<br><br>He unpacked, changed his shirt for a fresh one, and washed the other. When he was ready, he left his room and walked along the passageway to the kitchen as Stefano had indicated.<br><br>Stefano looked up from the bench where he had been chopping a fine green herb. There was a piece of broiled fish on a plate on the bench beside him, garnished with bright red tomato.<br><br>&#x201c;You are hungry?&#x201d; Stefano said cheerfully. &#x201c;Fish? A little vegetable? Bread? Yes?&#x201d; He held out the plate and gestured toward a table with a chair pulled up to it. He took a carafe of red wine and poured two glasses full. &#x201c;A little raw still,&#x201d; he said, putting one glass on the table in front of Charles and the other in the second place, where he sat down himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Eat,&#x201d; he encouraged. &#x201c;Give thanks to God, and enjoy.&#x201d; He reached across and took one of the slices of fresh crusty bread, dipped it in olive oil, and put it into his mouth.<br><br>Charles found himself doing the same. He must have been far hungrier than he realized. The food was delicious and he ate it all without giving it thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You like to walk?&#x201d; Stefano asked cheerfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed,&#x201d; Charles agreed. &#x201c;How far up can I go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All the way up to the crater. But you have to be very careful. Never go up alone, in case you fall. Always take someone with you, and let me know.&#x201d;</p><h2>There Is No Mistaking a Pierce Arrow</h2><p>A history of the Pierce Arrow automobile.</p><p></p><h2>Tank Versus Tank: The Illustrated Story of Armoured Battlefield Conflict in the Twentieth Century</h2><p>This study of tank tactics and strategy explains the international development and deployment of the tank against itself and a background of technical innovations and growing threats from mines, grenades, aircraft and missiles.

Greenberg&#xfffd;&#xfffd;&#xfffd;</strong>was honored in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America with the Ellery Queen Award for lifetime achievement in mystery editing.

Among the more celebrated authors that were gathered to honor Bradbury's 350 editions in 30 countries around the world are Isaac Asimov (with a tribute), Orson Scott Card, Gregory Benford, Charles L. Grant, Richard Matheson, F. Paul Wilson, Norman Corwin, Robert Sheckley, the late Charles Beaumont and his son Christopher Beaumont (his debut short story)--and Bradbury himself, who offers ``The Troll,'' a lost story (but one of his best!) from 1950 that Bradbury repolished for Nolan. He also contributes a moving if muzzy, modestly voiced memoir about his early writing (``...I was advancing from terrible into awful, on my way to mediocre''). This is a gleeful crew, each writer linking his story in some way to Bradbury tales or characters. Nolan's wife Cameron Nolan offers ``The Awakening,'' a solid work about the sexual awakening of Douglas Spaulding of Dandelion Wine, while Nolan himself offers a wildly entertaining parody, ``The Dandelion Chronicles'' (``The Waukegan crowd sighed, gasped, choked, cried out, the look of the great dream-colored climbing strawberry rocket in their round Illinois eyes...''). The longest work of devotion here, and perhaps the most powerful, is Orson Scott Card's ``Feed the Baby of Love,'' tying Dandelion Wine's 1928 time period to the present. Robert Sheckley's ``The Other Mars'' is a witty updating of what spacemen might find on a Bradburyized Mars today, oddly still a place of mythic fantasy. Christopher Beaumont's ``The Man with the Power Tie'' tells of the son of the psychiatrist in Bradbury's ``The Man in the Rorschach Shirt,'' who finds himself wearing a horrible tie that soaks up luck and energy. First-rate in every way, stories, editing, and as an act of love. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Following this "discovery," a handful of parents declared that a mercury-containing preservative in several vaccines was responsible for the disease. If mercury caused autism, they reasoned, eliminating it from a child's system should treat the disorder. Consequently, a number of untested alternative therapies arose, and, most tragically, in one such treatment, a doctor injected a five-year-old autistic boy with a chemical in an effort to cleanse him of mercury, which stopped his heart instead. <br><br>Children with autism have been placed on stringent diets, subjected to high-temperature saunas, bathed in magnetic clay, asked to swallow digestive enzymes and activated charcoal, and injected with various combinations of vitamins, minerals, and acids. Instead of helping, these therapies can hurt those who are most vulnerable, and particularly in the case of autism, they undermine childhood vaccination programs that have saved millions of lives. An overwhelming body of scientific evidence clearly shows that childhood vaccines are safe and does not cause autism. Yet widespread fear of vaccines on the part of parents persists. <br><br>In this book, Paul A. Offit, a national expert on vaccines, challenges the modern-day false prophets who have so egregiously misled the public and exposes the opportunism of the lawyers, journalists, celebrities, and politicians who support them. Offit recounts the history of autism research and the exploitation of this tragic condition by advocates and zealots. He considers the manipulation of science in the popular media and the courtroom, and he explores why society is susceptible to the bad science and risky therapies put forward by many antivaccination activists.</p><p><p>Honorable Mention-2008 PROSE Award in Biological Sciences, Association of American Publishers</p>| <p> <i>CHOICE</i> Outstanding Academic Title, 2009</p><p>A physician-scientist debunks the controversial claim that vaccines are linked to autism.</p></p><h2>National Audubon Society Pocket Guide to Familiar Rocks and Minerals (Audubon Society Pocket Guides)</h2><p>Shows and describes gneiss, marble, slate, sandstone, shale, limestone, granite, basalt, talc, and gypsum, and discusses crystal structure and identification tests</p><p>The author, Charles W.

They have the Random Actor behavioral profile identified in the early 1990s by Dan Korem, the critically acclaimed author of the classic text, The Art of Profiling - Reading People Right the First Time, 2nd ed. Korem details this profile and extraordinary cases where in an intervention he identified has thwarted scores of Random Actor attacks in schools, companies, and military theaters. Example: For over fifteen years, scores of Texas school districts have stopped attacks and threats by applying his research and many education and law enforcement professionals believe it is the reason that Texas has not had a mass shooting/bombing since the trend started in 1997. In the early 1990s, Korem predicted in the early 1990s with nearly 100% accuracy that suburban and small town communities the statistically safest communities are the locales where the attacks will occur and why. Newton, CT, Columbine, Virginia Tech, and most company attacks, for example typically occur in these locales. More importantly, he identified a three point intervention that guides a student/adult out of the Random Actor profile often within weeks. On a large scale, after 9-11 only one region in the US didn t have Random Actor threats . . . it was the only region where 2500 educators used Dan s research. They pre-identified students and provided intervention before they ever plotted an attack. Additionally, 150 times a day schools are evacuated because of Random Actor threats. The reason this trend is growing across the nation is that 6% of all students now have the Random Actor traits (up from 1-2% at the time of the Columbine Massacre) and approximately 3-4% in the workforce. The urgency to apply this research is even greater than when Rage of the Random Actor was first released.</p><p>Dan Korem is the president of Korem &amp; Associates which has trained over 35,000 professionals rapid-fire profiling skills more than any firm in the world.

Dan is also the author of The Art of Profiling Reading People Right the First Time 2nd ed and Suburban Gangs The Affluent Rebels.I have no doubt that had we at Pearl [Mississippi where the first attack occurred in 1997 that started the global trend] identified students with Random Actor traits and applied Korem s intervention techniques, we would not have had an attack. --William H.

Most people believe that plant and animal domestication allowed humans, finally, to settle down and form agricultural villages, towns, and states, which made possible civilization, law, public order, and a presumably secure way of living. But archaeological and historical evidence challenges this narrative. The first agrarian states, says James C. Scott, were born of accumulations of domestications: first fire, then plants, livestock, subjects of the state, captives, and finally women in the patriarchal family - all of which can be viewed as a way of gaining control over reproduction. </p><p>Scott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture, the advantages of mobile subsistence, the unforeseeable disease epidemics arising from crowding plants, animals, and grain, and why all early states are based on millets and cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the "barbarians" who long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension between states and nonsubject peoples. </p></p><p><b>James C.

In the 1970 s, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving.</p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain.</p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool.</p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package.</p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work. More titles were added, each title requiring months of research and design.</p><p>Today, STREETWISE� produces over 130 titles for major destinations, regions and countries throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. We have grown from the back of a motorcycle to selling millions of maps around the world.</p><p>Yet each title is still painstakingly researched and updated. STREETWISE� is one of the only, if not THE only map company that conducts research by walking or driving an area to ensure accuracy. After all, what good is the map if what you hold in your hands doesn t match what you see on the street sign? This lengthy fact checking results in superior accuracy; in effect, we ve done the work, now you have the adventure.</p><p>In the end, it s not about the map, it s about getting out and finding your own authentic experience wherever you go. It s about being in a city or a region and discovering things that you never thought you would find. You can do this if you have confidence and you have confidence if you have a great map.

Illustrated with more than 100 photographs, this biography tells his story, beginning with his humble origins and his early life as a relatively conservative priest and bishop. Only in the last three years of his life, with his consecration as archbishop of San Salvador, did he undergo an astonishing transformation--some have called it a conversion. Embracing the church's "option for the poor," Romero became a courageous voice for the voiceless, embarking on a path he knew would lead to his death. <br><br>This biography reveals both his humanity as well his extraordinary faith and courage. It offers a stunning portrait of the gospel challenge for our time.</p><p>Scott Wright served as Director of the Religious Task Force on Central America. He is co-author of Oscar Romero: Reflections on His Life and Writings.<br><br>Octavio Duran, a Salvadoran Franciscan, served as Romero's personal photographer and accompanied him on many travels.Unprecedentedly violent, the twentieth century abounded in Christian martyrs, none more memorable than Oscar Romero (1917&#x2013;80), Catholic archbishop of the capital of El Salvador, killed by a still unidentified gunman while celebrating a memorial mass in the chapel of his chosen residence as archbishop, a cancer hospice. In this copiously illustrated tracing of his life, Wright eventually points out the parallels Salvadoran Catholics have found between Romero and Jesus, principally that the final ministry of each lasted three years and that each proclaimed the truth of the faith unto death. Despite his own humble origins, Romero had given little intimation that he would be the tireless advocate of the poor and oppressed against the wealthy and powerful that he became. Within weeks of his archiepiscopal ordination, the death-squad assassination of his Jesuit friend Rutilio Grande catalyzed his transformation from seemingly shy, punctilious church bureaucrat into quietly implacable champion of the maltreated poor. Rife with quotations and therefore resembling a documentary-film transcript more than a formal biography, this is a fine commemoration of an exemplary man. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Concise Encyclopedia of Preaching</h2><p>This book will find users among practicing preachers, as well as among academic students of preaching.

Introductory chapters define vernal pools; provide overviews of their formation and physical-chemical-hydrological characteristics; and present data critical for assessing, regulating, and managing pool ecosystems. The chapters that immediately follow the introduction explore the biology of microscopic life forms such as bacteria, algae, and fungi and the great variety of higher plants associated with vernal pools. The next chapters delve into the descriptions, distributions, habitat requirements and life-history strategies of pool animals, and the ecological processes and patterns associated with the composition and dynamics of pool communities over time. A final chapter discusses research needs and conservation considerations that are a part of the ongoing effort to recognize, understand, protect, and manage vernal pools as viable elements in the landscape of eastern North America. An extensive appendix identifies all animals that have been reported from vernal pools of the region and describes their habitat requirements, geographic distribution, and life history characteristics. Technical terms related to vernal pools are defined in a glossary. An extensive bibliography contains a vast listing of published literature, websites, and unpublished reports.</p><p>Elizabeth A. Colburn, Ph.D., is an aquatic ecologist who has spent much of the past twenty-five years studying, teaching about, and working for the protection of vernal pools and other small wetlands in the formerly glaciated northeastern United States. She worked for Massachusetts Audubon for eighteen years, and presently is on the staff of Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts.A key strength of Vernal Pools is its coverage of the diverse invertebrate and vertebrate fauna of these temporary water bodies, including discussions of life history and food chains. Colburn discusses adaptive strategies that are necessary for invertebrates to survive in these ephemeral environments. The detailed, referenced lists of faunal taxa will guide students as they assess these relatively unknown aquatic systems. These chapters not only capture the author's vast experience with vernal pools but also her enthusiasm for sharing their secrets with others. --C Michael Falter, professor emeritus of aquatic ecology and limnology, College of Natural Resources, University of Idaho (BioScience, Vol. 56, No. 10, October 2006)<br><br>Elizabeth Colburn has written a book that should prove to be a valuable resource to a wide group of people, from land managers to scientists to interested landowners. This is a well-organized, well-written, well-illustrated book. As we become increasingly aware of the ecology and importance of vernal pools, Colburn's book should be one that is readily available on the bookshelf of anyone interested in or working on a landscape with vernal pools. --Craig Anderson, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Natural Areas Journal, Vol. 26 (4), 2006)<br><br>The author spent more than 25 years studying vernal pools and other small wetland areas, and is a noted authority in the field. She has produced a highly needed volume which should be read by every aquatic biologist, herpetologist and anyone interested in our national environment.

Lee&#x2019;s Army of Northern Virginia constantly bedeviled the Union Army of the Potomac and its many commanders. Instrumental to that success at places like Second Manassas and Chancellorsville was Lee&#x2019;s corps commander Stonewall Jackson, who became one of the most popular and respected generals of the Civil War. <br> Despite the Confederates&#x2019; success in holding off the Union&#x2019;s offensives in the East, however, the Union made steady progress in the Western theater, winning battles like Shiloh, capturing New Orleans, and sealing off the Mississippi River at Vicksburg. Like the Union generals in the East, Confederate generals in the West were either mortally wounded in battle (Albert Sidney Johnston) or proved ineffective (Braxton Bragg, John Pemberton). One of the only bright spots in the West for the Confederacy was Irish immigrant Patrick Cleburne, whose successes earned him the nickname &#x201c;Stonewall of the West&#x201d;. Where so many Confederates were failing, Cleburne's strategic tactics and bold defensive fighting earned him fame and recognition throughout the South, even leading Lee to call him "a meteor shining from a clouded sky."<br> Unfortunately for Cleburne, he is also remembered today for reasons other than his battlefield successes. Cleburne was tasked with leading an assault that he heartily opposed during the Battle of Franklin near the end of 1864, but he obeyed the command and was killed in the assault within the Union lines. The general was so legendary even among Union soldiers that the valuables on his body were looted before his body came back to Confederate lines Upon hearing of his death, Cleburne&#x2019;s old corps commander noted, &#x201c;Where this division defended, no odds broke its line; where it attacked, no numbers resisted its onslaught, save only once; and there is the grave of Cleburne." <br> Cleburne is also remembered for a bold and novel idea that he proposed to the Army of Tennessee in 1864. Realizing the Confederates&#x2019; deficiency in manpower and resources, Cleburne suggested freeing the South&#x2019;s slaves so that they would fight for the Confederacy. It was such a radical idea that the Army buried it, and even when the Confederacy was on its last legs entering 1865, it could not muster the political support to emancipate some of their slaves to fight. <br> The Stonewall of the West: The Life and Career of General Patrick Cleburne chronicles the life and career of the Stonewall of the West, analyzing his record in the war and assessing his legacy.

No one.&#x201d;<br> <br>My orthodontist continued adjusting my latter-life braces while explaining all he knew about his friend&#x2019;s marriage. Their story matched so many others. Names and locales differed, but the basics remained the same. She had an affair. He retaliated with an affair of his own. Hers was brief, accompanied by intense guilt and a strong desire to restore her marriage. His was not. It evolved from a vengeful fling to an intense craving to be with his new paramour for the rest of his life.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can help. I&#x2019;d say the odds are three out of four that I can help them fall in love again.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what I wanted to say, but his hands were in my mouth. When he finally gave me a rest, I spoke the words with a quiet confidence born of experience with thousands of couples. My orthodontist&#x2019;s reaction was not nearly as confident, but he was intrigued enough that he asked me to explain.<br> <br>I told him about the LovePath. What it is. How it works for people who are single or married. Why it can change the course of lives, even when that seems impossible. I concluded by asking him to use his influence to get his friends to come to a Marriage Helper weekend workshop, sessions geared specifically for couples in crisis. I promised him that I would make a personal appearance to present the section on the LovePath and to meet his friends. I told him that it made no difference if they wanted to save the marriage or not; if they attended the workshop, we still had a 75 percent chance of saving the marriage, even if one or both wanted the marriage over. &#x201c;Put all the pressure you can on them.

As with most of us, I have learned through personal experiences&#x2014;both good and bad&#x2014;but I have also learned from social and medical science, which I study constantly. Most important, I have learned from working with tens of thousands of couples and guiding them successfully through a process that creates, deepens, or restores love.<br> <br>This process is the LovePath.<br> <br><b>THE MOST WONDERFUL RUMOR</b><br> <br>If I were to ask several great philosophers to define the meaning of life, I imagine I would receive a variety of responses, from the religious to the philosophical. However, most of the answers, regardless of their complexity, would ultimately have something to do with that simplest of words, the idea that launched ten thousand pop songs and old movies, and the quest that every world religion ultimately embraces: <i>love.</i><br> <br>As human beings, we have needs that scientists can explain and quantify:<br><br>We need a breath of oxygen every couple of seconds.<br> <br>We need water every few hours.<br> <br>We need food every day, and we need shelter every night.<br><br>These are the simple physical requirements of survival. However, we need love and acceptance, too. Once those more basic survival needs are taken care of, we spend most of our lives searching to fulfill the great desire that satisfies the soul&#x2014;the experience of love.<br> <br>This thing we all want so badly doesn&#x2019;t cost a dime, yet the pure form we seek is more precious than gold. I am speaking, of course, about what we might call &#x201c;true love.&#x201d; Because you are a human being, I believe you know exactly what I am talking about.<br> <br>Of course, there is bad love. I imagine you could tell some stories about your own experiences with this. If bad love could be cashed in at the bank, we would all be very wealthy.<br> <br>However, true love is another thing entirely. None of us wants to compromise on the quality of love that we get out of life. We want love that overpowers, that sweeps us off our feet.<br> <br>So how do we get our hands on it?<br> <br>Some people believe there is no such thing. They say that as long as people themselves cannot be true, there can be no true love. Sure, most of these cynics have fallen head-over-heels in love, just like everyone else. But as often as not, after love fails, people decide that maybe it was all an illusion, a hormonal hiccup, a biological itch that had to be scratched. A passing fancy after some fancy passes. Love comes, the skeptics say, and then it goes. It&#x2019;s simply too good to last.<br> <br>Others believe that love exists, but that it&#x2019;s a mysterious force, a powerful, roaming emotion with a mind of its own. It is a viral infection of passion that we catch for a while only to lose. This thing called love, they claim, is no more within our control than an asteroid plummeting from outer space to flatten us on the sidewalk. Love is mercurial. After all, you didn&#x2019;t hire Cupid, and neither did your mate. The little winged fellow flew out from behind a bush one day and fired a couple arrows your way, like in the cartoons. The trouble, according to this myth, is that the narcotic on the tip of those arrows is temporary. It wears off, and there&#x2019;s nothing you can do about it.<br> <br>Ask some of the Hollywood stars who are regulars in the gossip columns; the narcotic on some of their arrows apparently lasts no more than two or three weeks.<br> <br>So there are those who say true love does not exist, and those who say true love does not endure.<br> <br>But for some reason, those of us who have known love can&#x2019;t believe the critics, can we? Because for all the bad love we&#x2019;ve endured, observed, and heard about, rumors persist of something that is not bad love at all, of something real and wonderful. Just when we think love has gone completely out of style, we run into some stubborn instance of a sincere, genuine, and powerful love. Have you ever seen an elderly couple like that? Say, two octogenarians as fully devoted to each other as they were half a century ago? These two do not just tolerate each other but absolutely dote upon each other. No, I am not talking about the gentleness and politeness common to many seniors. I&#x2019;m talking about a very obvious passion between two ordinary human beings&#x2014;a passion that has endured and even grown stronger, year by year. A passion that keeps the life and light shining in their eyes even in their declining years.<br> <br>But real love is not confined to some past generation. There are couples out there who enjoy a fabulous and fulfilling love relationship every day. Do they ever bicker? Absolutely. Do they act like love-struck teenagers who are obsessed with each other? Nope, we are not talking about hearts-and-flowers stuff, but mature, fully developed love that makes better human beings out of everyone who finds it.<br> <br>Interested in learning about that kind of love, and the path to find it? Keep reading.<br> <br><b>GETTING ON THE RIGHT TRACK</b><br> <br>Years ago, I began to ask serious questions about this mysterious human experience of love. I had a life history that raised serious questions in my mind and spirit. I could see my life as a twisting path from childhood to adolescence to adulthood.<br> <br>I wondered how I fell in love, how I fell out of it, and if I could ever fall in love again.<br> <br>As a young man, my path intersected with that of another human being, Alice, who eventually became my wonderful wife. She was heading somewhere in life, based on her identity, her needs, and her goals. I was heading somewhere else, based on my own. We felt a mutual <i>attraction</i>, which is the first stage of the romantic experience. I bought into everything about Alice that I experienced with her&#x2014;her identity, her needs, and her goals as I understood them. (Pay close attention to that last phrase; in time we will have much more to say about it.) Alice bought into the totality of what she encountered in Joe Beam. What we experienced is the event of <i>mutual acceptance</i>.<br> <br>Then, after connecting in such a fulfilling way, the emotional narcotic kicked in. There were joy, excitement, and that thrill that comes like a great wave and washes two people toward the impulse to become life partners. This is <i>attachment</i>.<br><br>Why was love so wonderful to find, yet so hard to maintain?<br> <br>All of these stages are standard. I could be telling the story of millions of people. But then comes the intersection of another factor: time. The passage of time changes nearly everything in its path. Including love.<br> <br>With the passage of time, my passion began to waver. What, I wondered, happened to me? Why had the road in my journey grown so difficult? Why was love so wonderful to find, yet so hard to maintain? I loved loving Alice; she loved loving me. Why did the &#x201c;drug&#x201d; wear off? Had it all been an illusion? Could we get back what we had had? Did we even want to?<br> <br>After fifteen years of marriage, I entered a period of my life that was painful beyond belief. Alice and I divorced. I lost my sense of who I was, wounding Alice and myself in the process. In time I found my way back onto the path&#x2014;not just the path of being committed to a relationship but also the path of making that relationship really work. After three years of divorce, Alice and I married each other again. I am here to tell you that it was not easy or neat to do so. It took personal growth, understanding, perseverance&#x2014;and a few swift kicks to my rear, among other things.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s what I discovered: There is a way. A starting point. A direction. A strategy to get to where we wanted to be. The power of love is <i>not</i> some mysterious extra-human emotional force whose mysteries and staying power are beyond our control. It is no simple itch that needs scratching. (Can you think of any &#x201c;itch&#x201d; that can wound us so deeply&#x2014;or that feels so good when we scratch it right?)<br> <br>No, what I discovered is a journey that I began to call the LovePath. Every single one of us has the opportunity to travel this road of self-understanding, interpersonal bonding, and ultimate gratification. Best of all, it&#x2019;s a way of living that we intentionally and proactively choose, rather than passively gain and lose. On this path, anyone can find and experience love, relationships can be built to last, and relationships can be rescued if they fail. The LovePath is the most hopeful, exhilarating message I know, so I have devoted my life to telling people about it. Those who understand and follow it master the art of falling in love.<br> <br>I work with thousands of people, both single and married, who are wanting to start the path, are somewhere on that path, or are stranded by the side of the road. In helping so many ordinary, struggling people understand the different stages of the LovePath, in helping them learn the art of falling and staying in love, I have seen miracles take place. We have been able to help lovers build relationships that work and keep working. On the part of the path that constitutes marriage, we have helped thousands upon thousands of couples reach levels of love they never expected to find. Perhaps even more fascinating, we have a record of accomplishment of saving three out of four crisis marriages&#x2014;marriages on the brink of ending when the couple attended our Marriage Helper seminar.<br> <br>I see the light go on in people&#x2019;s eyes as they understand their journey for the first time. Moreover, I know they want to make it, that they&#x2019;ll find the happiness they&#x2019;ve always wanted.<br> <br>This approach works; I have seen it. I have lived its success myself, and I have the scars to prove what happens when we stray from the path. I have been interviewed on many radio and TV programs to share the keys of a healthy, thriving, and fulfilling relationship.<br> <br>Now I look forward to sharing those keys with you.<br> <br><b>WHAT IS LOVE?</b><br> <br>Dr. Robert Sternberg, provost and senior vice president at Oklahoma State University, developed a model for understanding love that is found in <i>Cupid&#x2019;s Arrow,</i> one of more than sixty books he has written. To understand love, Sternberg divides it into its three basic components: intimacy, commitment, and passion.<br> <br>These are not the steps of the LovePath, but rather results of following the LovePath. They are what we seek in true love, and the LovePath brings them into existence for us. Before beginning the path, let&#x2019;s explore what Dr. Sternberg and others have learned about the dimensions of the love we so want and need.<br> <br><i>Intimacy</i><br><br>Intimacy is being transparent, building trust, and allowing another to look deep into your soul.<br> <br>Intimacy is closeness, warmth, and the feeling of being bonded together. When men hear the word, they tend to think of it as something they do. Women, on the other hand, think of it as something they feel. Intimacy is truly knowing one another or, taking the very sound of the word, <i>into-me-see.</i> Intimacy is being transparent, building trust, and allowing another to look deep into your soul. Intimacy means giving respect, developing deep friendship, and connecting on a level that words never reach.<br> <br>Without intimacy, true love cannot exist. Yet intimacy is one of the most difficult things to master because to achieve it, two individuals must allow their souls to go naked before each other, ensuring that their love is for the real person&#x2014;not a picture the person has painted. When one feels intimacy with another, she feels that the other is a friend in the deepest and most meaningful sense of the word. He is one who knows her as she truly is, not as she represents herself in different environments and situations. He sees her weaknesses, flaws, or failures yet continues to believe the best about her. He understands her deepest desires, her dreams, and her fanciful wishes&#x2014;even those she would be embarrassed for anyone else to know.<br> <br>He knows what she is afraid of, what she will fight for, and, perhaps, die for. He is aware of her consistencies and her inconsistencies, but never bothers to catalog either. He cares about what she wanted to be when she grew up and understands her feelings...</p><h2>The CLUE ON THE SILVER SCREEN (NANCY DREW 123)</h2><p>While attending a film festival on Martha&#39;s Vineyard, teen detective Nancy Drew investigates the disappearance of a brilliant film, whose never-seen ending someone is murderously determined to keep secret.

History and Class Consciousness, which helped to create Western Marxism, is the book for which Luk�cs is best known, and some of his pronouncements have become famous. Nevertheless, History and Class Consciousness was condemned in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and Luk�cs later repudiated its ideas, and came to believe that in it he had confused Hegel's concept of alienation with that of Marx. It has been suggested that the concept of reification as employed in Martin Heidegger's Being and Time (1927) shows the strong influence of History and Class Consciousness, though such a relationship remains disputed.

This &#39;Lady of the Lake,&#39; as she was dubbed by the police and the press, was the first in a terrifying series of decapitation murders that haunted Cleveland for the next few years. From 1934 to 1938, the &#39;Torso Killer&#39; left the corpses of at least twelve victims in and around the Kingsbury Run area of Cleveland. A frightened city turned to its safety director, the legendary Eliot Ness, who focused more energy and manpower on this investigation than any previous police action in Cleveland. But the killer was never arrested, or even officially identified. In the Wake of the Butcher: Cleveland&#39;s Torso Murders is the first detailed, book-length examination of these horrific crimes. Where previous examinations of the Kingsbury Run murders have relied almost exclusively on contemporary newspaper coverage, this compelling account is based on police reports, autopsy protocols, and personal interviews with the descendants of victims and investigators, and unpublished manuscripts. Illustrated with maps, rare crime scene and morgue photographs, and newspaper photos, this carefully researched true crime study offers a detailed account of one of the most sensational unsolved murder cases in the nation&#39;s history. Badal presents his evidence carefully, allowing the gruesome facts to speak for themselves. Along the way he dispels some long-held rumors about the crimes and confirms others; such as the legend of Ness&#39;s &#39;secret suspect.&#39; In the Wake of the Butcher presents its compelling case and leaves readers to come to their own conclusions about these notorious Cleveland murders.</p><p>James Jessen Badal is assistant professor of English at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland.

He was elected to the board of trustees of the Cleveland Police Historical Society in 2000. He is the author of <i>Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts</i> (Kent State University Press, 2005)."Floating down the river, chunk by chunk by chunk/ Arms and legs and torsos, hunk by hunk by hunk!" goes the jingle that terrorized Cleveland from 1934 to 1938, when 12 known victims were found dismembered. The book's protagonist is Chief Investigator Peter Merylo, who was assigned to this case in 1936, stayed on it until he retired in 1943, and continued to maintain an interest in it until his death in 1958. Unlike today, policemen then were allowed to keep case files they worked on during their career. Hence, the files were in the possession of Merylo's daughter, who made them available to Badal (English, Cuyahoga Community Coll.). Elliot Ness, the man who put Capone and his men behind bars, was separately assigned to the case but could not crack it, which tarnished his reputation and started a downward tailspin from which he never recovered. The culprit was never apprehended, but Badal provides the readers with possible suspects without ever concluding who the real killer was. This is a well-researched book on a subject that remains a haunting mystery in Cleveland to this day. Readers should beware, however, as it contains very graphic photographs.

She was determined to be sensible about the whole thing; that was, until Gijs suggested that she marry him.<br><br>She liked Gijs very much, and she knew he was fond of her. Companionship seemed as good a basis as any for a marriage&#x2014;who needed romance anyway? But it turned out Gijs was in love, and Serena couldn't work out who the lucky woman was.<br><br></p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The April sun was bright and warm even at the early hour of half past seven in the morning; it shone through the window of Serena Potts' bedroom in the Nurses' Home, on to her bright head of dark hair which she was crowning somewhat impatiently with her cap. The cap was a pretty trifle, spotted muslin and frilled and worn with strings, but she had tied these in a hurry, so that the bow beneath her pretty chin was a trifle rakish. She gave it an angry tweak, anchored the cap more firmly and raced from the room, along the long bare corridor and down two flights of stairs, into the covered way leading to the hospital, to arrive a minute or so later, out of breath, at the breakfast table.<p>Her arrival was greeted by cries of surprise by the young women already seated there, but she took no notice of these until she had poured her tea, shaken cornflakes into a bowl and sat herself down.</p><p>'No need to carry on so, just because I'm early,' she pointed out equably. 'Staff's away and there's only the first-year students and Harris on, and you know what Hippy's like if anything comes in a second after seven-thirty.' She raised her dark, thickly lashed eyes piously and intoned primly:</p><p>'You are aware, are you not, Sister Potts, that I will accept no responsibility for any cases brought into the Accident Room after half past seven precisely?'</p><p>She began to bolt down the cornflakes. 'I bet the floors will be strewn with diabetic comas and overdoses by the time I get there, and Harris will be arguing with everyone within sight.'</p><p>She buttered toast rapidly, weighed it down with marmalade and bit into it, and everyone at the table murmured sympathetically&#x2014;at one time or another they had all had Nurse Harris to work for them&#x2014;a scholarly girl, with no sense of humour and a tendency to stand and argue over a patient when what was really needed was urgent resuscitation. Serena found it difficult to bear with her, just as she found Sister Hipkins difficult. Hippy was getting on for fifty and one of the team of Night Sisters at Queen's, and while she was adequate enough on the medical side, she was hopeless in Casualty and the Accident Room; besides, accidents had a nasty habit of arriving just as she was about to go off duty, and she was a great one for going off punctually.</p><p>Serena wolfed the rest of her toast, swallowed tea in great unladylike gulps, said 'bye-bye' a little indistinctly and went off briskly to the Accident Room.</p><p>It, and Casualty, occupied the whole of the ground floor of one wing of the hospital. Each had its own Sister in charge, but as the two young ladies in question took their days off on alternate weekends, it meant that today being Monday, Serena would be in charge of both departments until Betsy Woods, who had Cas, returned at one o'clock. She swung into the waiting-room now, casting a practised but kindly eye over the few people already seated on the benches. She recognized several of them; workers from one of the nearby factories, apparently accident-prone, with cuts and grazes clutching their tetanus cards in their hands as proof positive that they were up-to-date with their anti-tetanus injections and thus free from what they invariably referred to as the needle.</p><p>Serena wished them a cheerful good morning, stopped with no sign of impatience when she was begged to stop by an old woman who wished her to look at an injured eye, and having done this, offered sympathy and the mendacious information that the doctor would be along in a few minutes, and sped on her way again. Bill Travers, the Casualty Officer, had been up most of the night, Staff Nurse Watts had whispered to her as she met her at the door, and the chance of him appearing much before nine o'clock was so unlikely as to be laughable, but the old woman had needed comfort. She crossed the vast waiting-room to the Accident Room entrance and met Sister Hipkins coming out of it.</p><p>'And high time too, Sister Potts,' said Hippy nastily. 'No staff nurse and an RTA in! I'm sure I don't know what you young women are coming to&#x2014;in my young days I wouldn't have dared to be late.'</p><p>'I'm not late,' said Serena with resigned calm. 'It's not quite ten to eight, I'm due on at eight o'clock, and you are off duty at the same time&#x2014;I don't know where you get the idea that you're off duty at half past seven, Sister Hipkins.'</p><p>She didn't wait for an answer, but went on past Hippy, oblivious of her furious look, intent on getting to the case before Nurse Harris had a chance to do her worst.</p><p>The Accident Room was semi-circular, with screened-off bays and a vast central area to allow for the rapid manoeuvrings of trolleys and stretchers and the easy passage of the doctors and nurses. The curtains had been drawn across the furthest bay and she started towards it, her eyes searching the department as she went, to make sure that everything was in its proper place.</p><p>Nurse Harris was standing by the patient, looking important, and while doing nothing herself, issuing orders to the other two more junior nurses with her. Serena promised herself ten minutes with Nurse Harris later on, said calmly, 'Good morning, everybody,' and went to look at the patient&#x2014;a man, young, and unconscious, presumably from the head wound visible through his blond hair. Serena took his pulse and pupil reaction and told the more senior of the two nurses to start cleaning the wound.</p><p>'His leg,' breathed Harris importantly, 'it's broken.'</p><p>Serena drew back the blanket covering the young man and saw the splints the ambulance men had put on. As she did so she asked:</p><p>'Did Sister Hipkins tell you to ring anyone?'</p><p>'No, Sister.'</p><p>'Then ring Mr Thompson'&#x2014;he was the RSO&#x2014;'ask him to come down here, please, and tell him it's an RTA. Head wound, probable fracture of left leg&#x2014;badly shocked, unconscious.' And when Harris didn't move, she added with a patience she didn't feel, 'Will you hurry, Nurse, and then come back to me here.'</p><p>She was cutting the outside seam of the torn trousers covering the injured leg by the time Harris got back. She was doing it very carefully because if it was properly done, the trousers could be repaired. Experience had taught her that not everyone had the money to buy new trousers, although this man looked prosperous enough; she had noted the gold wrist watch and cuff links, the silk shirt and the fine tweed of his suit, and his shoes were expensive.</p><p>'Make out an X-ray form, Nurse,' she told Harris, 'and one for the Path Lab too&#x2014;I daresay they'll want to do a crossmatch. What about relatives?'</p><p>Harris looked blank, and Serena, holding back impatience, asked:</p><p>'His address&#x2014;you've got that? Was he conscious when they got to him?'</p><p>'Yes, Sister. But Sister Hipkins said we weren't to disturb him when he was brought in, and the ambulance men didn't know, because he was only conscious for a few minutes when they reached him.'</p><p>Serena counted silently to ten, because when she was a little girl, her father had taught her to do that, so that her temper, which was, and still was, hot at times, could cool. It was a silly childish trick, but it worked. She said with no trace of ill-</p><p>humour: 'Go and make sure the trolleys are ready, Nurse, will you? Then bring in the stitch trolley.'</p><p>Later, she promised herself, she would go and see the Number Seven, Miss Stokes, and see if something could be done to get Harris off the department. Her eyes flickered to the clock. Two part-time staff nurses would be on at nine o'clock, and thank heaven for them, she thought fervently. She had the splint off now with the most junior of the nurses helping her, and turned to wish Mr Thompson a friendly good morning as he came in.</p><p>He was a thin young man with a permanently worried expression on his pleasant face, but he was good at his job. 'I thought you might want to take a look at this head before the orthopaedic man gets here,' explained Serena. 'Sorry to get you down so early, Tom.'</p><p>He smiled nicely at her and set to work to examine the patient. 'Nice-looking bloke,' he commented as he explored the scalp wound. 'Do we know who he is?'</p><p>'Not yet '</p><p>'Unconscious when they found him?'</p><p>'No&#x2014;not all the time, and he was conscious for a very short time when he got here.'</p><p>He gave her an understanding look. 'Hippy on last night?'</p><p>Serena nodded. 'I'll go through his pockets as soon as you've been over him.'</p><p>'Um,' agreed Mr Thompson. 'Where's this leg?'</p><p>She whisked back the blanket and pointed with a deceptively useless-looking little hand. There was a discoloured bump just above the ankle and a sizeable bruise. 'Pott's,' she said succinctly. 'Now you're here I'll get this shoe off.'</p><p>Mr Thompson obligingly held the leg steady while she eased it off and after he had taken a closer look said: 'You're right&#x2014; X-ray, and we'd better see to that head too. I'll do it now, shall I? It only needs a couple of stitches, so if everything's ready</p><p>I'll get down to it, then Orthopaedics can take over when he's been X-rayed.'</p><p>Serena waved a hand at the small trolley Harris had wheeled in. 'Help yourself. Do you want a local? He might come to.'</p><p>She looked down at the man on the examination table and encountered bright blue eyes staring at her. He smiled as he spoke, but she was unable to understand a word. She smiled back at him and said to no one in particular: 'Foreign&#x2014;I wonder what</p><p>he said?'</p><p>Her query was answered by the patient. 'I will translate. I said: What a beautiful little gipsy girl.' His English was almost without accent. He smiled again and watched admiringly while Serena's dark beauty became even more striking by reason of the col...</p></p><h2>A Slender Thread : Rediscovering Hope at the Heart of Crisis</h2><p>his astonishing book by the prizewinning, bestselling author of A Natural History of the Senses reveals Ackerman&#39;s parallel lives as an observer of the wildlife in her garden and as a telephone crisis counselor. &#34;(Ackerman) brings a luminous and illuminating combination of sensuality, science, and speculation to whatever she considers.&#34;--San Francisco Examiner.</p><p>Diane Ackerman has generally turned her unusual sensitivity to consideration of the natural world and the human experience of it. In <b>A Slender Thread</b>, she journeys down a vastly different road, describing her involvement with a telephone crisis center in the college town where she lives. The callers want her to talk them out of suicide, and their fear and sadness is a weight she at first has trouble bearing gracefully. <p> </p><blockquote> "It's no bother. That's why we're here," I say, trying not to sound dutiful or perfunctory. I want him to stay calm, but I also want him to feel comfortable about calling. As usual, I wish I had more control over my voice, wish I could sculpt its nuances so that, regardless of the exact words I used, the tone would tell a caller like this one, <i>You're not alone. We're here to help you, or, if help is impossible, at least to understand.</i> I think it's possible to insinuate your emotions into your voice wholeheartedly like that, to speak sentences charged with pure emotion, as if they were part of an opera in which indecipherable words float on waves of heart-stirring and meaningful music. I just can't figure out how best to do it. </blockquote> <p> Ackerman explores human despair as she would a magnificent cavern, always moving toward the light of understanding.

Shaping natural forms to man's plan has always challenged gardeners. These books deal with quite different approaches to this task. Agnelli's, a delight of timeless villas and vistas, is a reminder of both Italian Renaissance spirit and Baroque exuberance. The geometric and the lushly wild, the enclosed niche and the panoramic view are captured in splendid photographs and elegant prose. Each villa and garden belongs to its special place. Where the Italian garden is a "place...where flowers, trees, etc. are grown for delight," the materials of Rambach's Gardens of Longevity are stones. The gardens blend Chinese philosophy and Japanese aesthetic perceptions of the universe: symbolic re-creations of the ideal, in an effort to capture "essence" rather than formal representation. Whether restored or preserved unchanged for centuries, the message of the stone raiser remains, leading the viewer toward wisdom through the knowledge of beauty. An impressive work with historical facts as well as philosophic insights. Both books are recommended for large collections and the latter for scholarly ones as well.

Even though she died over 45 years ago, her books still sell very well. Margaret loved animals. Most of her books have animals as characters in the story. She liked to write books that had a rhythm to them. Sometimes she would put a hard word into the story or poem. She thought this made children think harder when they are reading. She wrote all the time. There are many scraps of paper where she quickly wrote down a story idea or a poem. She said she dreamed stories and then had to write them down in the morning before she forgot them. She tried to write the way children wanted to hear a story, which often isn&#39;t the same way an adult would tell a story. She also taught illustrators to draw the way a child saw things. One time she gave two puppies to someone who was going to draw a book with that kind of dog. The illustrator painted many pictures one day and then fell asleep. When he woke up, the papers he painted on were bare. The puppies had licked all the paint off the paper. Margaret died after surgery for a bursting appendix while n France. She had many friends who still miss her. They say she was a creative genius who made a room come to life with her excitement. Margaret saw herself as something else - a writer of songs and nonsense.</p><h2>AIA Guide to New York City</h2><p>Since the <b>AIA Guide to New York City</b> was first published in 1967, it has been recognized as the ultimate guide to the metropolis's buildings, in all five boroughs -- Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island -- from nineteenth-century brownstones and tenements to modern high-rise apartments and museums.

Visit her at PeternellevanArsdale.com.The Beast Is an Animal ONE<p></p> <br>Nights were long for Alys.<br> <br>And they were always the same. Her mother washed her and dropped her flannel nightshift over her head. She tucked Alys between linen sheets and under wool blankets that felt heavy on Alys&#x2019;s restless limbs. Then came Alys&#x2019;s night-long entrapment by darkness and quiet and the absence of sleep.<br> <br>Alys looked longingly after Mam as she left the room. Mam turned back once and smiled at Alys, then closed the door behind her, snuffing the glow of light from the warm kitchen. Alys imagined her father sitting out there, pipe in mouth, toes near the fire. Then she lay in bed listening to the sounds of the house fall around her&#x2014;the low murmur of her parents, the clattering of a dish, the footsteps on wood floors.<br> <br>Then silence.<br> <br>She could hear them breathing. Mam&#x2019;s soft sighs, Dad&#x2019;s snores, a moan.<br> <br>Alys was seven now, and she&#x2019;d been this way for as long as she could remember. She dreaded the night.<br> <br>If only she were allowed to get out of bed. It was the knowing that she couldn&#x2019;t get out, that was what made sleeping so impossible for her. Told to lie still and sleep, Alys felt the strongest urge to do exactly otherwise. Her eyes instead flew open and stayed that way. She had no siblings so she couldn&#x2019;t know this for sure, but she&#x2019;d been told that she was an odd child this way, that most children knew to give in to sleep when the time came. Alys could not do this.<br> <br>Alys decided that this night would be different. This night, when the sighs and the snoring rose in the air, she would declare an end to her nights of entrapment. She would make the night her own.<br> <br>She waited long after silence fell, just to be sure. Then she dropped her feet to the cold wood floor. It was end of summer, near harvest, and although the days were still warm, already she sniffed autumn in the air. She found her woolen stockings and boots, a wool overdress. She was not a child who needed to be told what to wear. Mam always told Alys that she was sensible that way.<br> <br>Alys wasn&#x2019;t being sensible now. This wasn&#x2019;t the wisest night for her to wander. She knew this, and yet she couldn&#x2019;t stop herself. She&#x2019;d made a plan, and after so much waiting, after such a long imprisonment, she refused to wait another night. She couldn&#x2019;t wait. She wouldn&#x2019;t. Not even after what had happened last night with the farmer and his wife, nor the night before that, when the wolves came and ate up all the chickens, and goats, and horses in the entire village of Gwenith. Alys was sad about Mam&#x2019;s chickens. They were so sweet and warm in her lap, and they laid such nice eggs.<br> <br>Alys had heard her parents talk about the farmer and his wife, the ones who were dead. They lived way out on the edge of the village, nearly to the fforest. Mam had said the only reason they were found at all is that someone thought the farmer might know what had happened to all the animals. Mam said that surely all that bloodshed was the work of a witch, and that was where the other witch and her twin girls had lived. And then Dad said that just because you had married one witch, didn&#x2019;t mean you had married another. Mam disagreed, and said she supposed it did mean that very thing, because then why else was the farmer dead? And weren&#x2019;t Mam&#x2019;s own dead chickens proof they were all being punished for that man&#x2019;s sins and whatever he and his wife had been getting up to out there where no one could see them? Then Dad had given Mam a look, and Mam realized that Alys was listening, and well . . . that was the end of that.<br> <br>Alys should have been afraid of the wolves and the idea of a witch being married to a farmer, but she wasn&#x2019;t. Alys, in fact, had never been afraid. Her favorite nursery rhymes were the scary ones. The ones about The Beast sucking out your soul and leaving behind nothing but gristle and skin. Those were the ones Alys liked best. When her friend Gaenor squealed and shut her eyes and clapped her hands over her ears, Alys just laughed and kept singing. Sometimes she&#x2019;d promise Gaenor she&#x2019;d stop, and just at the moment Gaenor trusted Alys enough to drop her hands from her ears and open her eyes again, Alys would continue:<br> <br>The Beast, It will peek in on you<br> <br>When you&#x2019;re fast asleep<br> <br>Open up<br> <br>Invite It in<br> <br>And oh your Mam will weep<br> <br>Alys stepped out of her room, listened again for Mam and Dad&#x2019;s breathing. Then she was through the kitchen and out the kitchen door before she could think twice or change her mind.<br> <br>The air was chill and moist and open around her. And the sky, oh the sky. It was awash in stars.<br> <br>Alys looked up at the sky, felt lifted up by it. She turned to see how it might look different, to catch parts of it that she couldn&#x2019;t bend her head back far enough to see. It was lovely to be so free, everyone in the village asleep, and Alys not even trying to sleep. If she could spend every night this way, Alys thought to herself, she&#x2019;d have no reason to dread it anymore.<br> <br>Standing in Mam and Dad&#x2019;s kitchen yard, Alys began to feel hemmed in again. She could sense the house rising up behind her, the coop and the barn on either side of her. And she knew that through the darkness rose their neighbors&#x2019; houses. What Alys wanted was a fallow field&#x2014;a stretch of tall grass that she could feel spreading out all around her as far as her eye could see through the dark. And Alys knew where just such a field lay. She only had to get herself to the road, follow it out of the village, and there it was, big and wide and bordered only by fforest that was even bigger and wider than the field.<br> <br>Her legs carried her through the dark. She held her arms out to either side, felt the night air float over and around her. She was alone but not lonely.<br> <br>Then the field. In she walked, feeling the long grass brush her skirts, scratch and tickle even through her stockings. No longer could she feel any kind of structure around her. When she reached the center of the field, she looked up again at the stars. The sky was an endless bowl tipped over, the stars pouring down on her like grains of light. She opened her eyes wide to take them in.<br> <br>She felt them before she saw them&#x2014;the women.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t that they made a sound. It was more the way they didn&#x2019;t make a sound that attracted Alys&#x2019;s notice, the sense of a presence without bodies attached. But they did have bodies, she saw. These women. These women made of mud and leaves. They floated through the grass and they saw Alys with their wide gray eyes that glowed even in the night, as if they were lit from within.<br> <br>And still Alys wasn&#x2019;t afraid. Curious, yes. Alys had never seen women like these before. They weren&#x2019;t village women&#x2014;at least not from any village that Alys had ever heard of. They didn&#x2019;t even look like travelers. Travelers were odd-looking sorts, but these women were odder. They looked, it occurred to Alys, more like trees than women.<br> <br>And then they were near her, next to her, standing either side of her and each resting a hand of mud and clay on her shoulders. They were slim, and although they were much taller than she, Alys realized that they weren&#x2019;t women at all. They were still girls. Older than Alys, but maybe not so much older. Not mothers, certainly.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; Only one of the girls said it, and yet it seemed like both of them did. Alys felt a kind of energy pass through her shoulders, a shivery thread connecting their hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Alys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Alys, go to sleep,&#x201d; the other said.<br> <br>When the other said it, Alys felt an instant tug in her eyes, like a curtain being pulled. But no, Alys thought, that wasn&#x2019;t what she wanted. She sent the curtain flying up again, opened her eyes wider. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to sleep,&#x201d; Alys said.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no fear in this one, Benedicta.&#x201d; The girl sniffed the air around Alys. She had been sniffed by Gaenor&#x2019;s dog just like that.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, there is no fear, Angelica.&#x201d;<br> <br>Benedicta. Angelica. Alys had never heard those names before. She thought they were beautiful. And there was something beautiful about these owl-eyed girls, their long dark hair tangled with branches and leaves.<br> <br>Then they left her. Just as quickly as they came, the girls floated on. Out of the field and into the dark, disappearing at a point off in the distance that told Alys nothing about where they were going.</p><h2>Egyptology: An Introduction to the History, Art, and Culture of Ancient Egypt</h2><p>Discusses the history of Egyptian studies and introduces the pyramids, pharoahs, gods, mummies, everyday life, the role of the Nile River, hieroglyphics, and Egyptian influences in the arts</p><p></p><h2>The Mirror Empire</h2><p><i>Nominated for a 2015 Locus Award for Best Fantasy and the 2015 David Gemmell Morningstar Award.</i><br><br><b>A stunning epic fantasy from two-time Hugo Award winner Kameron Hurley.</b><br><br>On the eve of a recurring catastrophic event known to extinguish nations and reshape continents, a troubled orphan evades death and slavery to uncover her own bloody past... while a world goes to war with itself.&nbsp;<br><br>In the frozen kingdom of Saiduan, invaders from another realm are decimating whole cities, leaving behind nothing but ash and ruin.

The brown Ford Taurus sedan rocked its way down a rutted gravel road, twin plumes of dust corkscrewing into the hot August air. The blindfold was a precaution in case he failed, which Rapp had no intention of doing. He stared out the window at the thick wall of pines that bracketed the lane. Even with the bright sun he could see no more than thirty feet into the dark maze of trees and underbrush. As a child he&#x2019;d always found the woods to be an inviting place, but on this particular afternoon it had a decidedly more ominous feel.<br> <br>A foreboding premonition hijacked his thoughts and sent his mind careening into a place that he did not want to go. At least not this afternoon. Still, a frown creased his brow as Rapp wondered how many men had died in this particular forest, and he wasn&#x2019;t thinking of the men who had fought in the Civil War all those years earlier. No, he thought, trying to be completely honest with himself. Death was too open-ended a word for it. It left the possibility that some accident had befallen the person, and that was a convenient way to skirt the seriousness of what he was getting himself into. Executed was a far more accurate word. The men he was thinking of had been marched into these very woods, shot in the back of the head, and dumped into freshly dug holes never to be heard from again. That was the world that Rapp was about to enter, and he was utterly and completely at peace with his decision.<br> <br>Still, a sliver of doubt sliced through the curtains of his mind and caused a flash of hesitation. Rapp wrestled with it for a moment, and then stuffed it back into the deepest recesses of his brain. Now was not the time for second thoughts. He&#x2019;d been over this, around it, and under it. He&#x2019;d studied it from every conceivable angle since the day the mysterious woman had walked into his life. In a strange way, he knew where it was all headed from almost the first moment she&#x2019;d looked at him with those discerning, penetrating eyes.<br> <br>He had been waiting for someone to show up, though Rapp had never told her that. Or that the only way he could cope with the pain of losing the love of his life was to plot his revenge. That every single night before he went to sleep he thought of the network of faceless men who had plotted to bring down Pan Am Flight 103, that he saw himself on this very journey, headed to a remote place not dissimilar from the woods he now found himself in. It was all logical to him. Enemies needed to be killed, and Rapp was more than willing to become the person who would do that killing. He knew what was about to happen. He was to be trained, honed and forged into an ultimate precision weapon, and then he would begin to hunt them down. Every last one of the faceless men who had conspired to kill all those innocent civilians on that cold December night.<br> <br>The car began to slow and Rapp looked up to see a rusted cattle gate with a heavy chain and padlock. His dark brow furrowed with suspicion.<br> <br>The woman driving the vehicle glanced sideways at him and said, &#x201c;You were expecting something a little more high-tech perhaps.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp nodded silently.<br> <br>Irene Kennedy put the car in park and said, &#x201c;Appearances can be very deceiving.&#x201d; She opened her door and stepped from the vehicle. As she walked to the gate she listened. A moment later she heard the click of the passenger door, and she smiled. Without an ounce of training he had made the right decision. From their very first meeting it was apparent he was different. She had audited every detail of his life and watched him from afar for several months. Kennedy was exceedingly good at her job. She was methodical, organized, and patient. She also had a photographic memory.<br> <br>Kennedy had grown up in the business. Her father had worked for the State Department, and the vast majority of her education had taken place overseas in countries where an American was not always welcome. Vigilance was a part of her daily routine from the age of five. While other parents worried about their kids&#x2019; wandering out into the street and getting hit by a car, Kennedy&#x2019;s parents worried about her finding a bomb under their car. It was drilled into her to always be aware of her surroundings.<br> <br>When Kennedy finally introduced herself to Rapp, he studied her for a long second and then asked why she had been following him. At the time Rapp was only twenty-two, with no formal training. If Kennedy had a weakness it was with improvisation. She liked things plotted out well in advance, and being so thorough, she had gone in assuming the novice would have no idea that she had been running surveillance on him. She had recruited dozens of people and this was a first. Kennedy was caught off guard to the point of stammering for an answer. The recruit was supposed to be the one struggling to understand what was going on. Rapp&#x2019;s recognizing her was not part of the script.<br> <br>Later, in her motel room outside Syracuse, she retraced her every move over the past eight months and tried to figure out where she had slipped. After three hours and seventeen pages of notes, she still couldn&#x2019;t pinpoint her mistake. With frustration, and grudging admiration, she had concluded that Rapp had extremely acute situational awareness. She moved his file to the top of her stack and made a bold decision. Rather than use the normal people, she contacted a firm run by some retired spooks. They were old friends of her father&#x2019;s, who specialized in handling jobs without creating a paper trail. She asked them to take an objective look at Rapp, just in case she had missed something. Two weeks later they came back with a summary that sent chills up Kennedy&#x2019;s spine.<br> <br>Kennedy took that report straight to her boss, Thomas Stansfield. Midway through reading the file he suspected what she was up to. When he finished, he slowly closed the two-inch-thick biography of the young Mitch Rapp and made her plead her case. She was concise and to the point, but still Stansfield pointed out the potential pitfalls and obvious dangers of leapfrogging the initial phase of training. She countered perfectly. The game was changing. He had said it himself many times. They could not sit back and play defense, and in this ever more interconnected world they needed a weapon more surgical than any guided bomb or cruise missile. Having spent many years in the field himself, Stansfield also knew this person would have to be uniquely autonomous. Someone who conveniently had no official record.<br> <br>Kennedy ticked off eight additional reasons why she felt this young man was the perfect candidate. Her logic was sound, but beyond that there was the simple fact that they had to begin somewhere. By Stansfield&#x2019;s reckoning this was an endeavor they should have started a good five years earlier, so it was with a heavy sigh and a leap of faith that he decided to proceed. He told Kennedy to forgo the normal training and take him to the only man they knew who was crazy enough to try to mold a green recruit into what they needed. If Rapp could survive six months of schooling at the hands of Stan Hurley, he might indeed be the weapon they were looking for. Before she left, Stansfield told her to eliminate any connection: Every last file, surveillance photo, and recording that could ever tie them to Rapp was to be destroyed.<br> <br>Kennedy pulled the car through the gate and asked Rapp to close and lock it behind them. Rapp did as he was asked and then got back in the car. One hundred yards later Kennedy slowed the vehicle to a crawl and maneuvered diagonally in an effort to avoid a large pothole.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why no security on the perimeter?&#x201d; Rapp asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The high-tech systems&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more often than not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they draw too much unwanted attention. They also give a lot of false alarms, which in turn requires a lot of manpower. That&#x2019;s not what this place is about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about dogs?&#x201d; Rapp asked.<br> <br>She liked the way he was thinking. As if on cue, two hounds came galloping around the bend. The dogs charged straight at the vehicle. Kennedy stopped and waited for them to get out of her way. A moment later, after baring their teeth, they turned and bolted back in the direction they&#x2019;d just come from.<br> <br>Kennedy took her foot off the brake and proceeded up the lane. &#x201c;This man,&#x201d; Kennedy said. &#x201c;The one who will be training you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The crazy little guy who is going to try to kill me,&#x201d; Rapp said without smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say he was going to try to kill you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I said he is going to try to make you think he&#x2019;s trying to kill you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very comforting,&#x201d; Rapp said sarcastically. &#x201c;Why do you keep bringing him up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you to be prepared.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp thought about that for a moment and said, &#x201c;I am, or at least as prepared as you can be for something like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>She considered that for a moment. &#x201c;The physical part is assumed. We know you&#x2019;re in good shape, and that&#x2019;s important, but I want you to know that you will be pushed in ways you never imagined. It&#x2019;s a game. One that&#x2019;s designed to make you quit. Your greatest asset will be mental discipline, not physical strength.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp disagreed with her but kept his mouth shut and his face a mask of neutrality. To be the best required equal doses of both. He knew the game. He&#x2019;d been through plenty of grueling football and lacrosse practices in the humid August heat of Virginia, and back then it was only a simple desire to play that kept him going. Now his motivation to succeed was much deeper. Far more personal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just try to remember... none of it is personal,&#x201d; Kennedy said.<br> <br>Rapp smiled inwardly. That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;re wrong, he thought. It&#x2019;s all personal. When he responded, however, he was compliant. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Rapp said in an easy tone. &#x201c;What about these other guys?&#x201d; If there was one thing that made him a little nervous it was this. The other recruits had been down here for two days. Rapp didn&#x2019;t like getting a late start. They would have already begun the bonding process and were likely to resent his showing up late. He didn&#x2019;t understand the delay, but she wasn&#x2019;t exactly forthright with information.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are six of them.&#x201d; Kennedy scrolled through the photos in her mind&#x2019;s eye. She had read their jackets. They all had military experience and shared, at least on paper, many of Rapp&#x2019;s qualities. They were all dark-featured, athletic, capable of violence, or at least not afraid of it, and they had all to one degree or another passed the extensive psychological exams. They had all showed a facility for foreign languages. In terms of a sense of right and wrong, they all hovered near that critical six o&#x2019;clock position on the mental health pie chart. That thin line that separated law enforcement officers from career criminals.<br> <br>Around the next bend the landscape opened up before them. A freshly mowed lawn roughly the size of a football field ran along both sides of the lane all the way to a white barn and two-story house with a wraparound porch. This was not what Rapp had expected. The place looked like a rural postcard complete with a set of rocking chairs on the big white porch.<br> <br>A man appeared from inside the house. He was holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Rapp watched him move across the porch. The man swiveled his head to the left and then right in a casual manner. Most people would have missed it, but Rapp&#x2019;s senses had been opened to the reality that the world was divided between those who were part of the herd and those who liked to hunt. The man was checking his flanks. He stopped at the top of the porch steps and looked down at them from behind a pair of aviator sunglasses. Rapp smiled ever so slightly at the realization that this was the man who was going to try to break him. It was a challenge he had been looking forward to for some time.</p><h2>Florida Fog Phantoms (American Chillers)</h2><p>Justin and his friend Caitlin try to discover why a mysterious, thick fog settles in the Tampa Bay area after a hurricane passes through.</p><p></p><h2>Violent Earth</h2><p>A spectacular reference book for the entire family, <i>Violent Earth</i> is an authoritative, stimulating, and visually arresting exploration of the dramatic forces that are constantly shaping our planet &#x2014; often without warning and with devastating results. <p>Using powerful photography, specially commissioned illustrations, and intuitive infographics, <i>Violent Earth</i> explores plate tectonics, vulcanology, and seismology in unprecedented detail.</p> <p>Drawing on the latest scientific research and including detailed maps, revealing areas of key geological activity, such as earthquake zones, volcanic sites, and plate boundaries, <i>Violent Earth</i> also looks at some of the most famous events associated with these places, from the historic eruptions of Laki, Iceland, which is credited with triggering the French Revolution, to the devastating earthquake in Haiti that killed more than 250,000 people in 2010.</p> AUTHOR INFO: <p>Established in 1846, The Smithsonian Institution is a world renowned research center, dedicated to public education, national service, and scholarship in the arts, sciences, and history.</p></p><p>A &#34;Good Morning America&#34; Favorite Coffee Table Book of 2011!</p><h2>Number Power 10: Pre-Algebra</h2><p><b>Number Power</b> is the first choice for those who want to develop and improve their math skills.

Statistical facts are presented with the interviews, warning that the shortage of priests will continue to escalate unless solutions are found. Unsworth claims that for every ten priests lost only six are ordained, and with the continued growth of the Catholic population the role of future priests will be radically altered. Each of the men interviewed offers his insights regarding the role of the priesthood and the special problems he must face.

Only the knights of the Table had ever been permitted to ride them, for they were bred to carry kings.</i> <br> <i>But there were no more than a handful of Arthur&#x2019;s knights left now.</i> <br> <i>When Arthur fell at Camlann&#x2014;and it seemed to all as if the day were lost&#x2014;it had been Guinevere who had taken command of his army&#x2014;and they had been eager to have someone, anyone, lead them. That, Mordred had not expected&#x2014;that she, of all people, would appear on the battlefield in borrowed armor at the head of a vast army. From the moment Arthur had sent her into exile, she had been preparing for this day. But she had come too late to save her husband and lord. Camelot had fallen.</i> <br> <i>She had given her dying husband into the care of the Lady of the Lake. She had taken his sword from his death-cold fingers.</i> <br> <i>And she had followed the fleeing Mordred and his army with all her host.</i> <br> <i>Mordred had broken Arthur&#x2019;s army at Camlann, and the years of fighting that had preceded it had stripped Britain of knights and fighting men. But Guinevere&#x2019;s army did not ride clad in mail and wearing steel. It was made up of Druids and monks, nuns and sorceresses&#x2014;the Old Ways and the New Faith coming together to oppose an enemy who would destroy all that was. And beside Guinevere rode The Merlin.</i> <br> <i>Nimue had been the first of Mordred&#x2019;s allies to desert him, and with the breaking of the spell she had put upon him, The Merlin was freed. When he had learned of Arthur&#x2019;s death, his wrath had been terrible to see.</i> <br> <i>Across all of Britain the two armies rode, one pursuing, one fleeing. And slowly, one by one, Mordred&#x2019;s allies and vassals deserted him. Arthur had died in the springtide. It was autumn when Mordred was brought to bay.</i> <br> <i>This was the end.</i> <br> <i>The trees were leafless, now, and the wind was cold. Behind Guinevere stood her husband&#x2019;s army and her own, each man and woman waiting with a deadly implacable patience to witness the end of the man who had destroyed everything they had worked so long to build. Before her stood the ancient oak tree that Mordred had once meant to be The Merlin&#x2019;s eternal tomb.</i> <br> <i>She would gladly have slain the black snake who destroyed her happiness and her husband&#x2019;s kingdom, but Mordred was so imbued with the powers of Death Itself he could not die. No earthly weapon could slay him&#x2014;but he could be bound, as he had intended The Merlin to be bound. And since his own magics had prepared the ancient oak, it was all the more fitting that the tree be the vessel to hold him.&#x2026; </i> <br> <i>Guinevere heard muffled shouting and the clink of chains. She looked to her right. Here came the Bishop of England in his red and white robes, carrying a golden cross atop a long pole. Beside him walked the Archdruid of Eire, barefoot, with spirals of woad covering every inch of his skin, his only garment a tabard of white bull&#x2019;s-hide. Behind them walked the White Horse Woman&#x2014;whom Guinevere&#x2019;s ancestors had worshipped&#x2014;the Lady of Apples, priests and holy people of every faith Britain held.</i> <br> <i>Before them walked The Merlin.</i> <br> <i>And behind them came Mordred, dragged by the last of Arthur&#x2019;s knights. His hands were bound with iron and silk and ivy, his mouth had been sewn shut, his body was weighted down with a hundredweight of silver chains, each link carved with runes of blessing and protection. But his eyes were unblinded, and they flashed with fury.</i> <br> <i>The Merlin began to chant.</i> <br> <i>The knights pushed Mordred toward the oak&#x2014;not with their hands, but with stangs made of sacred oak.</i> <br> <i>And when his body touched it, Mordred began to sink into the tree as if its wood were softened wax. He struggled, eyes wild with anger and power. Still, the knights thrust him backward, and still The Merlin chanted. In a moment more it would be done.</i> <br> <i>Then to her horror, Guinevere saw that Mordred had torn loose the sinews that had sewn his mouth shut. He roared out a single terrible word. The knights pushing him forward fell to their knees, their screams drowned in those of the holy ones who had come to see justice done.</i> <br> <i>But The Merlin had not fallen&#x2014;and he shouted three syllables she did not understand, and did not want to. There was a flash and a roar. Brightness. Darkness. Guinevere cried out, fighting to control her panicked mount.</i> <br> <i>When she could see again, the oak&#x2019;s bark was seamless. The Merlin still stood before the oak, but his face was gray with terrible pain and weakness now, and he leaned heavily upon his staff for support. There was no sign of Mordred.</i> <br> <i>The Merlin staggered forward, summoning his failing strength. As he pointed at the oak, words of fire wrote themselves into the wood.</i> <br>Oh Thou who wouldst meddle in the affairs of Light and Darkness, Touch Not the Sacred Oak sealed by Merlin&#x2019;s Own Hand, for herein lies imprisoned the traitorous son of the Great Bear: Medraut Kinslayer the Accursed. Flee, lest his undying evil take you for its own! <br> <i>The Merlin turned at last, to look at Guinevere. &#x201c;It is finished,&#x201d; he said, in a voice flat with exhaustion.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Spirit shivered in the chill of the Girls&#x2019; Locker Room, but as cold as it was, she still wasn&#x2019;t in any hurry to get changed for class. <i>I never thought I&#x2019;d miss Mr. Gail and Mr. Wallis,</i> she thought ruefully. <i>But at least I guess I understood them. They might have been horrible, but they weren&#x2019;t killers.</i> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the way it was supposed to go. <br>She&#x2019;d thought&#x2014;oh she&#x2019;d been so na�ve!&#x2014;that once the kids had routed the Shadow Knights at the Sadie Hawkins Day Dance, the trouble would be over. Whatever the Shadow Knights had wanted to do on February 2nd, they&#x2019;d failed. Nobody had died. People had gotten hurt, but nobody had <i>died.</i> They&#x2019;d proved they could win. <br>It hadn&#x2019;t changed anything. And what was even scarier was, it was becoming more and more obvious that the Bad Guys weren&#x2019;t the secret society within Oakhurst called the Gatekeepers. They weren&#x2019;t a bunch of faceless Shadow Knights. They were the Oakhurst faculty. <br>At least the ones who were left. People kept vanishing here, and if you were smart you pretended you didn&#x2019;t notice. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d better get moving,</i> she thought, closing her locker reluctantly. At least she wasn&#x2019;t the only one here trying to delay the inevitable. She turned to head for the gym. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Spirit, &#x2019;scuze me&#x2014;&#x201d; Trinity Brown started to walk past her, then paused. &#x201c;You know, when you got here you were, like, a waif. You <i>do</i> realize you&#x2019;ve gotten all ripped, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Trinity chuckled. &#x201c;Wish I was. Guess I was born to be a string.&#x201d; She held up her hand in a half wave and walked on. <br>Spirit blinked in surprise, staring after Trinity. She hadn&#x2019;t even realized Trinity&#x2014;who was <i>not</i> a string, merely supermodel-lean&#x2014;knew her name. It was kind of ironic&nbsp;&#x2026; now that Oakhurst really <i>was</i> out to kill them, the kids were a lot kinder to each other than they had been when she had arrived in September. One of the first things she&#x2019;d learned about Oakhurst was that friendships weren&#x2019;t encouraged. <br> <i>But I</i> have <i>friends. Good friends. I don&#x2019;t know what would have happened to me without Loch and Burke and Addie&nbsp;&#x2026; </i> <br> <i>And Muirin.</i> <br>She just hoped Muirin was still her friend. <br> <i>I&#x2019;d better get going.</i> She looked down at herself. Trinity was right: she <i>was</i> ripped. <i>If I live to graduate, the only job I&#x2019;d qualify for is superhero,</i> she thought bitterly. <i>Or maybe government assassin. I sure don&#x2019;t know how to do anything else.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The class was <i>Systema.</i> It was a kind of Russian martial art that focused on controlling the joints of one&#x2019;s opponent. What it meant in practice was that they were all supposed to try to kill each other. When Anastus Ovcharenko started teaching the course, they&#x2019;d worked out on mats. Now they worked out on the bare wood floor. Spirit and Trinity stood at the back of the group of students (not that something like that would save you). Muirin should have been here, too, but these days Muirin didn&#x2019;t spend a lot of time in her classes&#x2014;and she saw plenty of Ovcharenko out of them. <br>He was already there, of course, smiling cheerfully as he waited for the last of them to arrive. Ovcharenko was always cheerful&#x2014;especially when he was about to hurt somebody. He always picked someone to spar with while the rest of them paired off against each other. He said it was to demonstrate the proper techniques. Spirit was pretty sure it was more about punishment. Dylan Williams (the official ringleader of the rebellion back in February) had been his favorite chew-toy for weeks, but he&#x2019;d managed to put Dylan in the infirmary yesterday, and Dylan wasn&#x2019;t here. <br> <i>I don&#x2019;t care who he picks today as long as it isn&#x2019;t me,</i> Spirit thought fervently. <br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Ovcharenko said, clapping his hands together and smiling. &#x201c;Who wants to dance with Anastus today? Ah! I know! You! Come here&#x2014;we will have fun together, eh?&#x201d; <br>He smiled and nodded encouragingly. Everyone shifted uneasily, until they were all spread out in a ragged line. For one horrified moment Spirit thought Ovcharenko had chosen her after all. <br>But he was pointing at Trinity. <br>&#x201c;You! Little girl! It is Trinity Brown, yes? You will come and dance with Anastus, yes? Come, come. I promise you I will be gentle.&#x201d; <br>Nobody laughed. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Trinity said.

I&#x2019;ve dropped mushrooms but refused painkillers. I&#x2019;ve popped blue-green algae to pull all-nighters, brewed kombucha for my cha-cha. I have meditated while having a coffee colonic (and let me tell you, if you can meditate with a tube up your ass, you are definitely headed toward enlightenment). I&#x2019;ve read channeling transcripts on how to find my Soulmate&#x2015;for which I blame at least two breakups and a few missed opportunities to get laid by good men. If I&#x2019;d been less fixated on the perfect twin flame, I might have been more easy...going. I temporarily broke up with the New Age to date New Physics. Everything happens for a reason. <br><br>Being on stage a lot as a &#x201c;motivational speaker,&#x201d; I was sermonizing about healthy boundaries and self-Love being a divine responsibility. Most people seemed to think, Well, she doesn&#x2019;t suffer fools. But behind the scenes I was suffering some serious foolishness. I took a lot of crap from lovers and other collaborators because I thought tolerance was the &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; course of action, or non-action as was the case. I practiced being less attached to my wants and more attached to my needs&#x2015;but it was really hard to tell the difference. I chose Freddie Mercury as my Spirit Animal. He helped. The show must go on. <br>... You can&#x2019;t seek approval on your way to sovereignty. Freedom is not something you need to earn.<br>Joy does not come from a checklist. <br><br>Chapter 5: excerpt<br>FULL OF YOURSELF: The curiosities of self-hatred, and the only guarantee of self-Love <br>...we&#x2019;re missing the deeper dialogue when it comes to self-Love and determination: Loving yourself, even when you do it most humbly, can attract some not-so-Loving responses. When you start to care more deeply about your own well-being, a whole new set of inner&#x2015;and outer&#x2015;challenges will surface in your life. Self-respect can create conflict. Just get used it. <br>...How to know that you Love yourself... You will Love more people, more deeply. This is the best part. Self-Love expands into Loving others. It&#x2019;s so perfect, and beautiful, and right. You&#x2019;re not trying to attain your own sequestered happiness. You look into your heart and see that it&#x2019;s connected to everyone else&#x2019;s. You feel that mystical and palpable kinship, and you want the same freedoms and fulfillment for others that you want for yourself. <br><br>Chapter 6: excerpt<br>YOU&#x2019;RE SPECIAL&#x2015;BUT NOT THAT SPECIAL: In search of worth <br>The need to feel special is a healthy human need. It means we&#x2019;re being seen and are loved for what&#x2019;s seen. But when you combine spirituality with an unchecked hunger to be &#x201c;special,&#x201d; you get spiritual glamour. And it&#x2019;s some nasty, nefarious stuff. <br>spiritual glamour (noun/verb): <br>1. regarding your spirituality as a qualification for special treatment; <br>superiority <br><br>2. New Age douche <br><br>Spiritual glamour&#x2013;pusses always and a way to insert their esoteric resum� into the conversation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been meditating for twenty-five years,&#x201d; or &#x201c;My work with the orphans...&#x201d; or &#x201c;Parmesan Yogi Wannawanda is a personal friend of mine and when I was yachting with him, he told me...&#x201d; We get it. You&#x2019;re buds with an Enlightened Master, so you must be special. <br>...On the ego&#x2019;s role in spiritual growth: Befriending our ego is a step to befriending our whole self. You&#x2019;re an original. If we&#x2019;re always looking to see how &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; others think we are, we will never tap the depths of our authentic selves. Their perceived opinions of us will be the greatest distractions to hearing and feeling our Truth. The desire to evolve must come from internal inspiration, not external motivation. <br><br>Chapter 8: excerpt<br>OPEN, GENTLE HEART. BIG FUCKING FENCE. Boundaries for spiritual people <br>...I saw the same boundary issues with my Soul Sisters as well. Other- wise remarkably powerful, get-shit-done women who couldn&#x2019;t tell their adorable but freeloading brother that it was time to move out of the guest room and get a job; or the gorgeous and articulate friend who kept quiet about the tantra teacher who crossed the line with her; or the whip-smart entrepreneur who couldn&#x2019;t put a &#x201c;stop payment&#x201d; on the check to the &#x201c;socially responsible&#x201d; consultant who gave her nearly fatal business advice. We were all so accustomed to directing our compassion outward that turning the tide of protective Love toward ourselves was discombobulating. We fought for causes, for relationships, for our children, for our co-workers, but it was terrifying to fight for ourselves.<br><br>Chapter 10: excerpt<br>THE SOUL OF SERVICE:<br>Conscious optimism and giving from your fullness <br>...according to a lot of spiritual perspectives, all is well in the Universe. Our enlightenment is inevitable. It&#x2019;s all progress. <br>I do believe that we will get to where we&#x2019;re headed&#x2015;to a more enlightened way of living and co-creating... I also believe that over-spiritualizing our global tragedies doesn&#x2019;t heal them&#x2015;it perpetuates them. And I believe in free will. So we have a choice: stubborn ignorance can slow us down and make us take the long way &#x2019;round to our destination, or we can make some radical shifts and get there with some efficiency. The Universe operates on free will&#x2015;and that means that both ascension and devolution are options. It&#x2019;s up to us. <br><br>Chapter 11: excerpt <br>YOU ARE THE GURU: The hottest truth of all <br>...I wasn&#x2019;t at the ashram for long but, as it happens for me in any situation of extreme restraint, I started feeling hornier than usual, and craving other circumstantially illicit things&#x2015;like a pack of smokes and some Led Zeppelin cranked really loud. Oh woe. My mind was having a fairly predictable reaction to discipline, but so was my heart. It was becoming clear that I was not made for this scene. <br>...Your breakthroughs have more to do with your own power than that of the expert or guru. Outside sources can be Soul resources&#x2015;but not because THEY know something that you don&#x2019;t. They are merely showing you your own wisdom. Wisdom is built, not bestowed. <br><br>Chapter 12: excerpt<br>FAUX FREEDOMS<br>When sacred sex goes sideways <br>...Between oppressive culturalization and the shifting expressions of feminism, I get why Yoni Puja empowerment workshops or an orgy at Burning Man might be appealing&#x2015;truly healing, even. For some of us, getting greased and going wild is exactly what we need to break the psychological chains and move up our own evolutionary spiral. <br>I also understand why so many progressive, spiritually focused women think they might look like prudes if they demur on the free Love. It can be easy to feel ever-so-slightly shamed for not being &#x201c;freer,&#x201d; as if they&#x2019;re repressed just because they don&#x2019;t want to go to the Proud and Powerful Pussy Power Summit and pair up with a guy they just met to find their orgasmic sweet spot. <br>Going wild isn&#x2019;t necessarily freeing. And restraint isn&#x2019;t always restrictive. What is the modern goddess to do? <br><br>Chapter 15: excerpt<br>DISCERNMENT IS EVERYTHING When the negative serves the positive <br>You can&#x2019;t have the Light without the dark. It&#x2019;s a primary function of metaphysical teachers to emphasize the power of the Light, but they can neglect to address the realities of dealing with the darkness. I was at an angel workshop (don&#x2019;t judge me), and a woman who was mentioning some government conspiracy theories was hushed by the workshop leader, &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t talk about negative things like that, it gives it energy.&#x201d; Please, if you can&#x2019;t talk about whacky conspiracy theories at an angel reading workshop, then where can you talk about them? <br>...Sometimes, you have to go right to the heart of an issue and call people on their bullshit-making&#x2015;which might not seem like a very &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; thing to do. But let me tell you...opinions used for raising standards are sacred indeed... Being discerning is not the same as being judgmental. <br>Discernment is big-minded and awake. Judgment is narrow-minded and operates in the dark. Discernment is our wisdom coming to life.</p><h2>Sidney Chambers &amp; Forgiveness Of Sins</h2><p>Sidney Chambers and the Forgiveness of Sins</p><p>James Runcie is an award-winning film-maker and the author of seven novels.

After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain.</p><p>Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew.</p><p>On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story.

The Society of American Historians awarded him the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Shaman as the best historical novel of 1991/1992. He was also voted "Novelist of the Year" by the readers of the Bertelsmann Book Club, and twice, in 1992 and 1995, he won the Silver Basque Prize for Spain's bestselling book. An earlier book, <i>The Rabbi</i>, was on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller list for 26 weeks. Noah Gordon lives with his wife in Brookline, Massachusetts.</p>Set in Spain under the Inquisition, this latest big historical novel from Gordon (Shaman; The Rabbi) follows the adventures of young Yonah Helkias as he stays true to his Jewish faith, escapes from misadventures and finds love. In Toledo, in 1489, a precious reliquary of a Christian saint, crafted by Yonah's silversmith father, disappears; Yonah's older brother, who was delivering the relic, is found dead; and compassionate physician Bernardo Espina begins to investigate the theft and murder. Meanwhile, the Inquisition starts to target Jews, including conversos like Espina (Jews by birth who have entered the Catholic church). The bulk of the novel takes place three years later, when the deadline for all Jews to leave Spain has arrived. Yonah, aged 13, joins thousands of his co-religionists headed for Spanish borders and ports, but instead of departing, Yonah remains behind. After witnessing Espina's death in an auto-da-f?, Yonah leads a fugitive existence as a farmer, a shepherd, a cathedral laborer, a pot repairer, a seaman and, finally, as an apprentice armorer under the demanding master Manuel Fierro. Delivering armor, he returns to Toledo, where he bargains with his family's persecutors to escape a dangerous rendezvous with relic smugglers. Then Yonah's master is fatally double-crossed; after avenging him, Yonah heads to Saragossa, where Fierro's brother trains him to becomeAlike the heroes of Gordon's The Physician and ShamanAa doctor. Yonah changes his name to Ramon Callico, marries a woman who knows his secret, but never gives up his desire to restore Espina's honor to his son, the stolen relic to the Church or his own soul to Judaism. Gordon has earned an international audience for his impressively documented historical narratives, his compassion for the trials of ?migr?s and his intricate descriptions of Renaissance crafts. Through a crowded landscape of characters and incidents, he illuminates the choices history forces on individualsAand, not incidentally, creates a grand, informative adventure and a completely engaging, unsentimental portrait of a turbulent time.

On the field and roaming the sidelines were seventeen future Hall of Famers, including Colts stars Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, and Gino Marchetti, and Giants greats Frank Gifford, Sam Huff, and assistant coaches Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry. An estimated forty-five million viewers - at that time the largest crowd to have ever watched a football game - tuned in to see what would become the first sudden-death contest in NFL history. It was a battle of the league&#39;s best offense - the Colts - versus its best defense - the Giants. And it was a contest between the blue-collar Baltimore team versus the glamour boys of the Giants squad. &#34;The Best Game Ever&#34; is a brilliant portrait of how a single game changed the history of American sport and is destined to become a classic.</p><p>Mark Bowden is the bestselling author of Killing Pablo, Finders Keepers, Guests of the Ayatollah and Black Hawk Down, which was made into a successful film by Ridley Scott. He is a national correspondent for the Atlantic Monthly.It&#39;s been fifty years since the 1958 championship between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants. More than simply a great game, it was a great game played at just the right time. The fledgling sport was about to step out from baseball&#39;s shadow as the medium of television stood poised to broadcast it to the masses in the 1960s. Bowden weaves solid research and mini-biographies throughout historical accounts of the time. Phil Gigante&#39;s deep tone is as steady as a scoring drive. The appropriate accents he uses to represent players, coaches, and others are the only creative enhancement needed to capture the inherent drama in this story. This should be required listening for any fan who doesn&#39;t yet know the significance of this seminal football game.

Once again, the powers-that-be ask liberal aristocrat Lord Charles Sheridan to investigate a crime, here the detonation of a bomb in Hyde Park that kills a suspected anarchist seemingly en route to Buckingham Palace shortly after the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. The explosion raises fear of further outrages, and the king's equerry delivers a royal request that Sheridan determine the extent of the terrorist threat. The lord's independent wife, Kate, slips into her usual role as unofficial helper, conducting a parallel inquiry. Atypically, there's no actual mystery to unravel, while the legitimate parallels between Edwardian England's fears of terror attacks and today's U.S. get lost amid heavy-handed touches such as naming the lead Scotland Yarder charged with protecting the British homeland "Ashcraft."

The words he delivered that afternoon would become among the most famous in presidential history. "Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate," Reagan said. "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall!"<p>In this riveting and fast-paced book, Romesh Ratnesar provides an account of how Reagan arrived at his defining moment and what followed from it. The book is based on interviews with numerous former Reagan administration officials and American and German eyewitnesses to the speech, as well as recently declassified State Department documents and East German records of the president's trip. Ratnesar provides new details about the origins of Reagan's speech and the debate within the administration about how to issue the fateful challenge to Gorbachev. <i>Tear Down This Wall</i> re-creates the charged atmosphere surrounding Reagan's visit to Berlin and explores the speech's role in bringing about the fall of the Berlin Wall less than two years later.</p><p>At the heart of the story is the relationship between two giants of the late twentieth century: Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. Departing from the view that Reagan "won" the Cold War, Ratnesar demonstrates that both Reagan and Gorbachev played indispensable roles in bringing about the end of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. It was the trust that Reagan and Gorbachev built in each other that allowed them finally to overcome the suspicions that had held their predecessors back. Calling on Gorbachev to tear down the Wall, in Reagan's mind, might actually encourage him to do it. Reagan's speech in Berlin was more than a good sound bite. Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we can now see the speech as the event that marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War.</p><p>Elegant and dramatic, <i>Tear Down This Wall</i> is the definitive account of one of the most memorable speeches in recent history and a reminder of the power of a president's words to change the world.</p></p><p><p>Romesh Ratnesar is deputy managing editor of <i>Time </i>magazine. The winner of numerous journalism prizes, he has written dozens of <i>Time </i>cover stories on U.S. foreign policy and international affairs and reported from many countries around the world, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Israel and the Palestinian territories. He lives in New York.</p><b><b>INTRODUCTION</b></b> <p>The morning of May 15, 1987, was a busy one for Ronald Reagan. &#x201c;Quite an agenda,&#x201d; he recorded in the diary he updated every day of his presidency. He reviewed names of possible appointees to a commission on AIDS&#x2014;the disease that was claiming tens of thousands of lives but which Reagan had only recently acknowledged. At a meeting of the National Security Council, Reagan found his disputatious secretaries of state and defense, George Shultz and Caspar Weinberger, feuding over whether the United States should agree to a major arms cut proposal made by the Soviet Union&#x2019;s leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan was also informed that a U.S. Army nurse had been kidnapped in Mozambique. &#x201c;I want her rescued if we have to blow up the whole d&#x2014;&#x2014;m country,&#x201d; he wrote later. After lunch and a meeting with regional newspaper journalists, the seventy-six-year-old president retired &#x201c;upstairs for the afternoon and evening,&#x201d; with a stack of material to read over the weekend. Among his papers were drafts of the speeches he was to deliver on an upcoming trip to Europe&#x2014;including one he would be giving on June 12 in West Germany, in the shadow of the Berlin Wall. </p><p>Even to some who knew him well, Reagan was a remote figure. His basic kindness and decency were obvious to all he encountered, but so were his emotional reserve and imperviousness to events that might disrupt his simple, sunny worldview. During his time in the White House, he rarely budged from a daily routine that included a lunch of soup and crackers, a light workout, and eight hours of sleep. On the morning of Reagan&#x2019;s first inauguration, the man he had defeated, Jimmy Carter, received word that fifty-two American hostages, held in Tehran for 444 days, were to be released. When Carter phoned to give Reagan the news, an aide to Reagan, Michael Deaver, told the outgoing president that Reagan was sleeping and couldn&#x2019;t be roused. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding,&#x201d; Carter said. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; Deaver replied. By the final years of his second term, Reagan was often disengaged from the daily business of the presidency. His official biographer observed at the time that Reagan was &#x201c;showing signs of depression, failing to read even summaries of important work papers, constantly watching TV and the movies.&#x201d; Reagan&#x2019;s celebrated speechwriter, Peggy Noonan, told an interviewer that when she met with Reagan before she left the White House in 1986, she had been struck most by his &#x201c;frailty.&#x201d; &#x201c;He nods and encourages you,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;re never quite sure he hears every word.&#x201d; </p><p>But Reagan could still rise to the occasion. &#x201c;He believed that giving speeches was one of the president&#x2019;s most important duties,&#x201d; says James Baker, who served under Reagan as chief of staff and later as treasury secretary. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known a president who was better at utilizing the bully pulpit, which is the most important thing that a president has.&#x201d; Reagan&#x2019;s gift for public speaking had been evident as far back as his days at Eureka College, when his peers tapped him as their spokesman during a student strike against the school president. That talent was honed by thousands of commentaries, radio broadcasts, town hall meetings, and fund-raising speeches Reagan gave before he even mounted his first campaign for office in 1966. His detractors confused Reagan&#x2019;s eloquence with glibness, dismissing his ability to connect with audiences as an old actor&#x2019;s trick. But those judgments now seem hollow; heard today, Reagan&#x2019;s best speeches&#x2014;&#x201c;Evil Empire,&#x201d; the elegy for the crew of the space shuttle Challenger, &#x201c;The Boys of Pointe du Hoc&#x201d;&#x2014;retain much of their rhetorical power. Reagan approached speeches not merely as public performances but as opportunities to present his views in clear and unmistakable terms. Even his closest aides said they often learned about Reagan&#x2019;s position on a given issue only after he mentioned it in a speech. Former President Gerald Ford once remarked in wonder that Reagan &#x201c;was one of the few political leaders I have met whose public speeches revealed more than his private conversations.&#x201d; </p><p>The address delivered by Reagan in West Berlin on June 12, 1987, was the 1,279th of his presidency. He was entering the twilight of his tenure. His long love affair with the American people had soured over the Iran-contra scandal. His approval rating had fallen twenty points in six months. On the world stage too, Reagan appeared a diminished figure, overshadowed by the dynamic Soviet leader, Gorbachev, whose push to reform the communist system seemed to be driving the course of history. In two dramatic summits to that point, Reagan and Gorbachev had established a promising personal connection, but their discussions had failed to yield tangible progress toward ending their nations&#x2019; rivalry. At their summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, the two leaders had come tantalizingly close to reaching an agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons, before the deal fell apart over Reagan&#x2019;s refusal to abandon his plan to build a space-based defense against nuclear missiles. Few experts in either country believed the Cold War was about to end. </p><p>But the world was changing. In Eastern Europe, small-scale rebellions against communist rule had begun to stir. On the eve of Reagan&#x2019;s visit, hundreds of East German youths revolted near the Berlin Wall when police tried to prevent them from listening to a rock concert in West Berlin. Whether the American president sensed the ground moving, or merely allowed himself to imagine it, is difficult to know. As Reagan climbed the dais in front of Berlin&#x2019;s Brandenburg Gate just after 2 p.m. on June 12, 1987, it is unlikely that he anticipated that by the end of the year he and Gorbachev would sign the first U.S-Soviet treaty to reduce nuclear weapons; that he would leave office in January 1989 declaring that &#x201c;the Cold War is over&#x201d;; and that just nine months would pass after that before the fall of the Berlin Wall. </p><p>And even the man known as the Great Communicator might not have believed, on that gray Berlin afternoon, that his words would become the most memorable delivered by any American president in the last quarter-century. Along with the assassination attempt against him in 1981, Reagan&#x2019;s appearance at the Brandenburg Gate remains the iconic image of his presidency. During the 2008 presidential campaign, <i>Time</i> named &#x201c;Remarks on East-West Relations at the Brandenburg Gate&#x201d; one of the ten best political speeches in history. <i>USA Today</i> rated &#x201c;Tear down this Wall&#x201d; the second most memorable quote of the last twenty-five years.* &#x201c;You look for one line you remember a president by,&#x201d; says Ken Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff who accompanied Reagan on that day in Berlin. &#x201c;FDR is easy. Bill Clinton is easy: &#x2018;I did not have sex with that woman.&#x2019; What is Ronald Reagan going to be remembered by? One line: Tear down this Wall.&#x201d; </p><p>Twenty years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is sometimes difficult for Americans to recall the antagonism, bitterness, and depredation that characterized the Cold War. For more than four decades, the United States and Soviet Union remained locked in a struggle, in President George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;for the soul of mankind.&#x201d; It was a conflict that distorted national priorities and led both countries into disastrous misadventures; hundreds of thousands died in the proxy conflicts waged by the superpowers around the globe. Wars against communist foes in Korea and Vietnam claimed the lives of more than 100,000 American troops. For millions living under communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the price of the Cold War was paid in the form of dismal health standards, diminished life expectancy, an absence of political freedom, and the crushing of individual will. And due to the U.S.-Soviet arms race, for half a century the world lived with the specter of nuclear war, a hair&#x2019;s-trigger away from Armageddon. </p><p>In this contest of wills, Berlin was the most visible staging ground. Divided into four sectors by the conquering Allies after World War II, the city came to embody the contrast between two competing ideologies: the vibrant, market-oriented democracy of the West versus the gray, statist socialism of the East. The Berlin Wall, built by the communists in 1961, was the Cold War&#x2019;s defining symbol. Stretching over 100 miles, reinforced with concrete, barbed wire, and dog runs, the Wall literally separated brother from brother, neighbor from neighbor, and block from block. During the thirty-eight-year existence of the Berlin Wall, at least two hundred East Germans were killed and another five thousand captured while trying to cross it. Symbolically, the Wall stood for the mistrust that plagued East-West relations during the postwar period. </p><p>Reagan loathed the Wall. On a trip to West Berlin in 1978, he was taken to an eighth-floor office overlooking it and told the story of Peter Fechter, the youth who had been gunned down by East German police in 1962 as he tried to crawl over. The authorities left Fechter unattended for nearly an hour, while he bled to death. &#x201c;Reagan just gritted his teeth when he heard all of this,&#x201d; says Peter Hannaford, a longtime aide who was with Reagan that day. &#x201c;You could tell from the set of his jaw and his look and some of the things he said that ... he was very, very determined that this was something that had to go.&#x201d; </p><p>Reagan&#x2019;s speechwriters knew this. From the start of the administration, they viewed themselves as the keepers of the flame of the Reagan revolution. The presidential trip to West Berlin in June 1987, which came on the occasion of the city&#x2019;s 750th birthday, presented an opportunity to create one last signature moment ...</p></p><h2>Heliconia an Identification Guide</h2><p>Heliconia, large tropical flowers native to Central and South America and some islands of the South Pacific, have become favorite horticultural subjects throughout the world.

Moore, one of the world's foremost experts on leadership and strategy, dispenses with simplistic models of corporate competition to argue that the complex, interdependent nature of today's business relationships is best understood as a form of ecosystem. He examines the profound strategic and managerial implications of this dynamic vision in <b>The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems</b> (HarperBusiness; May 21, 1997). </p><p> Moore offers a sweeping new understanding of how businesses interact, cooperate, and compete; his ecosystem analogy more closely reflects the actual experiences of today's companies. He names four distinct stages in the growth of a business ecosystem-"The Terrain of Opportunities," "The Revolution Spreads," "The Red Queen Effect," and "Renewal or Death"-and shows how businesses can meet the changing demands and goals of each. He not only offers a powerful metaphor for understanding the new business environment, he also shows how to apply this understanding to flourish and succeed in a climate of organized chaos. </p><p> Moore vividly illustrates his thesis not only with examples from the natural world, but also with case studies of actual companies. Drawing on a wide range of contemporary examples-from the complex alliances among IBM, Intel, and Microsoft to the territorial tactics employed by Wal-Mart against Kmart, to the coevolution of Ford and Chrysler-Moore shows how new strategies and visionary leadership are required in these new business ecosystems. </p><p> Moore's insightful and iconoclastic analysis of the contemporary business climate suggests a new strategic model for the interaction of companies. He conclusively demonstrates that our traditional understanding of competition is no longer adequate to the realities of the business environment, and that an ecosystem understanding of business interactions has profound implications for corporate strategy. <b>The Death of Competition</b> will change the way people think about competition and cooperation. </p><p> <b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: </b> </p><p> James F.

We visit churches and museums and see how the fusion of Christianity and art has produced sublime paintings and sculptures in a rich variety of styles. We glimpse, through the work of artists of faith, reflections of the spiritual and cultural climate of their day. Some, such as Michelangelo, are among the greatest geniuses the world has ever seen; others are virtually unknown. Yet whether experience persecution or spiritual revival, war or peace, political repression or freedom, they have all been inspired by the person and message of Christ and his church to make visible the invisible in mosaic, paint and stone; to enrich the mind, touch the heart, and feed the soul. This richness of life is in danger of death in our contemporary culture of facts and figures, where time is money, speed drives us, and noise blocks out the inner voice.

It was cold, but the boy could detect a faint drifting fall of moisture from the dark sky.</p><p>The man was still sitting there.</p><p>Was this the fifth day in a row? Yuri counted backwards and decided that it was. It had snowed three days earlier, putting another white layer on the park. The man had been there before and during the snow.</p><p>Every afternoon as Yuri walked home from school the man had been sitting there. Sometimes he was reading a paperback book. Sometimes he seemed to be just thinking. He was a block of a man made even bulkier by the thick coat and fur hat he wore.</p><p>The man with a broad face similar to that of hundreds of thousands of Rus sians did not look up from his book. Yuri approached and sat at the end of the bench away from the man, who turned a page slowly.</p><p>Darkness was no more than an hour away and people were trudging or scurrying home from work after emerging from the Bitsevsky Park Metro station at the end of the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line, the orange line.</p><p>Yuri, eleven years old and supremely confident, felt safe enough. The man was old and certainly slow, his left leg oddly still. Yuri could run with confidence if he felt the need. He was the fastest boy in his form at school. Thin, pale-skinned with blond hair under his earflapped wool hat, he had nothing much to look forward to when he got to the apartment where his mother might be home and his father certainly would not be yet. His grandfather would be in front of the tele vi sion, what ever he was watching the enemy. They would be having a dinner of salad with the vegetables chopped into little pieces, leftover bean soup with sour cream, and saut�ed mushroom stew with onions and sour cream served over mashed potatoes. The mushroom stew was also left over and stored in those plastic see-through containers with blue plastic tops.</p><p>Yuri&#x2019;s mother worked in the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Solnovo, seventeen miles outside of Moscow. Her job was quality control, watching the bottles fill with syrup, water, and carbonation, looking for even the slightest imperfections. She was well paid. She had frequent headaches. On headache days, Yuri sometimes prepared simple dinners or at least opened the plastic containers, heated the contents, and set the table.</p><p>Yuri&#x2019;s father was a bartender in Vodka Bar near the Park Kulutry Metro stop. His father, if he were still home, would leave for work shortly after Yuri came home. Though Yuri was sure his father loved him and his mother, he did a poor job of hiding his desire to get away from his father-in-law each night.</p><p>And so Yuri sat on the bench.</p><p>The man read on.</p><p>"Why are you sitting here?" Yuri said after a minute or two.</p><p>"I am waiting," said the man.</p><p>"For whom?"</p><p>"You," said the man, still not looking at the boy.</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>"Or someone who would be curious enough to wonder who I might be and why I was sitting here on an early winter day."</p><p>Yuri didn&#x2019;t understand, but he was curious.</p><p>"What are you reading?"</p><p>The man held up his ragged paperback. Yuri looked at the cover. The title was in English, a language Yuri was slowly and painfully learning in school.</p><p>"Ice?"</p><p>"Da, yes."</p><p>"You are reading an En glish book about small rodents?"</p><p>"Not &#x2018;mice,&#x2019; " said the man. "Ice. Frozen water. It&#x2019;s a story. I would offer you a Red October chocolate, but you might think I was a dirty old man."</p><p>"Are you?"</p><p>"No," said the man.</p><p>"Then you can offer me a chocolate."</p><p>"What makes you think you can trust me?"</p><p>"You have been coming here for five days. You are slow. I think I can trust you. At least I can get away if you try to do something. People are passing and I am sure I am faster than you are."</p><p>The man shifted his weight and with a grunt reached into his coat pocket and came up with a brown see-through bag, which crinkled invitingly. Yuri had a near passion for chocolate. The man reached into the already open bag and fished out a wrapped candy. Yuri could see the familiar image of the woman marioshki figure on the wrapper.</p><p>"Throw it," Yuri said.</p><p>The man threw the candy and Yuri caught it. Yuri could catch almost anything thrown to him. He fully expected to be the goalkeeper on his lower school team next year. Yuri pocketed his candy. The man opened a second one and popped it into his mouth, stuffing the wrapper into his pocket.</p><p>"You want another for here?"</p><p>Yuri shrugged. The man came up with another wrapped chocolate and threw it to the boy, who caught it.</p><p>"You are a goalkeeper," the man said.</p><p>"Yes," said Yuri, this time unwrapping the chocolate and taking a small bite from the end. The candy cracked between his teeth and spread its taste as he chewed it.</p><p>"My son is a goalkeeper," the man said. "He was a goalkeeper. He&#x2019;s old enough to be your father."</p><p>Yuri wondered how old this man must then be, but he was too polite to ask. "What position did you play?"</p><p>In answer the man leaned forward and rapped his knuckles against his leg. It sounded like a knock at Yuri&#x2019;s front door.</p><p>"No position," said the man. "My leg was lost when I was your age. So you see that there is no way I could chase a ten-year-old goalkeeper down the street."</p><p>"I am eleven and I wasn&#x2019;t worried," said Yuri, popping the last tidbit of candy into his mouth.</p><p>"It is probably a good thing to worry when you are near the park and nightfall is approaching."</p><p>Two women passed them by with barely a glance. The women were both carrying their string grocery bags weighted down with the night&#x2019;s dinner. Both women were fat, possibly sisters. The fatter of the two kept shaking her head as the other woman raised her voice higher and higher. Yuri caught the word baranina. Lamb.</p><p>Yuri and the man watched the two women until they were far down the street and the loud voice was lost in a riff of the wind.</p><p>The man shifted again, holding the candy in his right hand and fishing his wallet out of an inner pocket with his left.</p><p>If he offers lots of money to do some unspeakable thing, I will go find a police car. There was always a police car roaming near the park. This was because . . .</p><p>The man held open the wallet to show a police badge.</p><p>"I am a policeman," said the man. "My name is Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov."</p><p>"My name is Yuri Platkov. I know why you are sitting here."</p><p>Porfiry Petrovich nodded.</p><p>"Him," said Yuri. "The Bitsevsky Maniac."</p><p>"You know about him?"</p><p>"Everyone who lives near the park knows about him. He attacks the old people who hang out around the park. He beats their heads in with a hammer and hides their bodies in the bushes. Some say he has killed fifty or more. You expect him to walk up to you and confess?"</p><p>"It has happened in the past, but I do not expect it."</p><p>"How would he even know you were a policeman?"</p><p>"He would know," said Porfiry Petrovich.</p><p>"So, you thought someone would just come and sit down and tell you that they knew who the Maniac was?"</p><p>"No, but that would be very nice, nicer even if the murderer himself were to sit where you are and confess. I do not expect it, but it would be nice."</p><p>"Then why sit here if you do not expect someone to come to you?"</p><p>"You came," said the policeman.</p><p>Cars were moving cautiously in front of them, windshield wipers rubbing faster than was called for by the falling cold mist. Both Yuri and Porfiry Petrovich watched a large white Chaika stretch limousine with tinted windows come by.</p><p>" We don&#x2019;t see cars like that here very much," said Yuri. "There&#x2019;s no place a car like that could be going."</p><p>"There&#x2019;s a big dinner at the Posvit Hotel on the other side of the park," said Porfiry Petrovich. "Our government is trying to convince a Japanese investment group to develop an area called Gargarin Street."</p><p>"How many has he killed now?" asked the boy.</p><p>"Many," said the policeman. "I can&#x2019;t tell anyone because the number might be important when we catch him."</p><p>The official internal number of victims, Porfiry Petrovich knew, was officially nineteen. The unreported number of victims was fifty-one. It was assumed that there were other bodies to be found .</p><p>"You are not hoping he will come out of the woods to confess?" Yuri said.</p><p>"No, I am not."</p><p>"Maybe you are hoping he will come by and try to kill you?"</p><p>"I have considered that possibility," said Porfiry Petrovich. "I expect that at some point he will come and sit down as you have. Or perhaps he will pass by letting our eyes make contact."</p><p>"Will you be here tomorrow?" Yuri asked.</p><p>"Perhaps," said Porfiry Petrovich, urging his plastic and metal leg to allow him to rise with some dignity.</p><p>Now that he was standing, Yuri could see that the man was neither tall nor short. He stood with his legs apart, reminding the boy of a cylindrical box of kasha on the kitchen shelf.</p><p>"Shall we shake hands, Yuri Platkov?" Porfiry Petrovich said, holding out a thick right hand.</p><p>Foot traffic had grown heavier. People streamed from the direction of the subway. It was safe enough. He placed his hand in that of the policeman. Yuri steeled himself to squeeze, but it wasn&#x2019;t necessary. The policeman&#x2019;s grip was firm but gentle.</p><p>"The Maniac has moved the bird feeders," said the boy.</p><p>The policeman knew the makeshift bird feeders made of shoe boxes or cereal containers. The feeders, tied by string or ribbon, were hung from the low branches of trees with piles of seed inside left by bird lovers. They existed in almost all parks within the city.</p><p>"Moved them where?" asked the policeman.</p><p>"Farther from the path, deeper into the trees," said the boy. "People have to move away from the eyes of others to p...</p></p><h2>The Mouse Woman Trilogy</h2><p>In the late 1970s, celebrated children&#x2019;s author Christie Harris published three books known as the Mouse Woman Trilogy.

The illustrated story begins in 1766 with Billy Marvel, the lone survivor of a shipwreck, and charts the adventures of his family of actors over five generations. The prose story opens in 1990 and follows Joseph, who has run away from school to an estranged uncle&#39;s puzzling house in London, where he, along with the reader, must piece together many mysteries. Filled with mystery, vibrant characters, surprise twists, and heart-rending beauty, and featuring Selznick&#39;s most arresting art to date, The Marvels is a moving tribute to the power of story.</p><p>Brian Selznick is the Caldecott Medal-winning creator of the New York Times bestsellers <i>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</i>, adapted into Martin Scorsese&#x2019;s Oscar-winning <i>Hugo</i>, <i>Wonderstruck</i>, adapted into Todd Haynes's eponymous movie, and <i>The Marvels</i>. Among the celebrated picture books Selznick has illustrated are the Caldecott Honor Book <i>The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins</i> by Barbara Kerley, and the Sibert Honor Book <i>When Marian Sang</i> by Pam Mu�oz Ryan. His books appear in over 35 languages. He has also worked as a bookseller, a puppeteer, and a screenwriter. He divides his time between Brooklyn, New York and San Diego, California.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;This brilliant journey through time in words and pictures is also a story of a theatrical family and their fortunes. This heavy tome opens to tell of one family, the Marvels, from 1766 to 1900 as their connection to the Royal Theatre in London begins and perhaps ends. In the first half of the book, all of this complex history is vividly conveyed through illustrations, with minor hints from playbills, cards, and letters that appear as part of the art. Selznick's ability to convey the passing of time and connections among characters is remarkable. Characters appear, shine, and disappear throughout the years, but certain motifs recur no matter where the spotlight is focused. The second portion of the story is conveyed entirely in text, building on the same themes but taking place in 1990 in a very different London, where the echoes from the past are particularly embodied in 13-year-old Joseph, a boarding school runaway searching for his uncle's house. He soon meets Uncle Albert, who seems less interested in getting to know his nephew than in the preservation of an anachronistic Victorian house which is more museum than home. The echoes from the earlier history are haunting, requiring Joseph to delve into the secrets of Uncle Albert and of the house without giving away his own. Selznick ends with a satisfying section of illustrations that embody the maxim of this family, "You either see it or you don't." VERDICT Complex, entertaining, and full of gorgeous art and writing, this is a powerhouse of a book.&#x2014;Carol A.

The writers include Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, and Sir Julian Huxley.</p><p><b>Timothy Leary</b>&nbsp;was one of the most famous countercultural icons of the 1960&#x2019;s. In 1957, the Harvard psychologist experienced a &#x201c;profound transcendent experience&#x201d; while taking hallucinogens in Mexico. No longer content with his work in personality assessment, Leary began advocating the psychotherapeutic and spiritual benefits of LSD. His &#x201c;experiments&#x201d; with LSD often involved students and wild &#x201c;tripping&#x201d; parties, which eventually led to his dismissal from Harvard. With patronage from heirs of the Mellon fortune, Leary continued his experiments and prolific writing career at a rambling estate in upstate New York known as Millbrook. In 1967, Leary spoke at a San Francisco &#x201c;Be-In,&#x201d; where he coined the phrase &#x201c;Turn on, tune in, and drop out.&#x201d; Labeled as &#x201c;The Most Dangerous Man in America,&#x201d; Leary had many run-ins with the law and served several prison sentences. He died of prostate cancer in 1996; the following year seven grams of his ashes were launched into space aboard a Pegasus rocket.</p><h2>Andr� Cadere: Peinture Sans Fin</h2><p>This first book in a two-volume set contains documentation of works from 1971 to 1978 by the key Polish-born, Paris-based Minimalist and Conceptualist, Andr� Cadere--who died in 1978 at the age of 45. (The second volume, sold separately, is a catalogue raisonn�.) Best known for his 1970s <i>Barres de bois rond</i>, wooden bars made of painted cylindrical segments, Cadere regularly upended the status quo by bringing his staff-like sculptural works to openings for other artists that he admired or was close to, such as Robert Ryman or Barnett Newman--whether he was invited to do so or not. The bars inevitably conveyed such strong presence that they intervened with the shows, simultaneously disturbing and initiating discussions on the system of art. This invaluable reference book is divided into historical exhibition views, invitation cards designed by Cadere and photos and stills of his cult-legendary performances.</p><p></p><h2>Dark Champion</h2><p><b>A Damsel&#x2019;s Plight</b><p>Orphaned and desperate, Imogen of Carrisford flees when a brutal lord invades and takes possession of her castle.

Bowen, a Minnesota native whose artwork is both vigorous and fresh, combines her alphabet with an almanac of seasons. The words she chooses to illustrate each letter are somewhat unexpected for the intended audience: "rendezvous," "upstairs," "junk"; but the brief, sometimes surprisingly lyrical text that accompanies them links everything in a sharply observant chronicle of northwoods life. There is an abundance of fun tidbits tucked into the pages as well--the fact that canoe paddles have to be kept tied high in a tree, for example, so they aren't mistaken for bear snacks, or information on the equal-opportunity parenting style of loons--both male and female sit on the eggs. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 4-- An alphabet book that is novel in overall concept, ABC words, and illustrations. Bowen has taken as her theme ordinary life in the Minnesota northwoods from January ("Aa" for "Antler") to December ("Zz" for "Zero" temperature). Each letter-word pair is accompanied by a brief, explanatory anecdote. Above it is a -page full-color woodblock illustration that contains true-to-life details that increase effectiveness. There are good find-it-in-the-picture text clues for pre-readers, while older children--especially those familiar with northwoods life--will reread and enjoy the book for Bowen's bold accuracy of concept and presentation. --George Gleason, Department of English, Southwest Missouri State University, Springfield<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reading Teacher Resource Book 7 - 2014 Ready Common Core</h2><p>Reading Teacher Resource Book 7 - 2014 Ready Common Core</p><p></p><h2>Abandoned (Donovan)</h2><p><b>The second book in a thrilling sci-fi action adventure, set on Donovan, a treacherous alien planet where corporate threats and dangerous creatures imperil the lives of the planet's colonists.</b><br><br><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author W.

A combat-hardened Corporate Marine private&#x2014;supposedly the toughest of the tough&#x2014;he fixed tired eyes on the patterns and swirls of stars. Wondrous stars. A sparkling, frosty hoar that glittered against the soot-black sky. <br><br>God, he wished he was out there. <br><br>He took a deep breath, caught the rank odor rising from inside his armor, and wrinkled his nose. He stank like shit in a toilet. He had lost count of the days that he and Shin had been living in their pro�tective gear. Thirty? Forty? Hard to tell since he&#x2019;d left his personal com back on the doomed aircar. Somewhere along the line, one day had merged into another and they&#x2019;d lost count. <br><br>Propped back in the shadow of the rocks, Shin gasped in pain. More than a week had passed since the slimy leech thing had bored its way into her foot. After weeks in armor, Shin had wanted a bath. They both had. They&#x2019;d drawn lots. She&#x2019;d won. <br><br>At the pool of clear water they&#x2019;d found, she had stripped off her armor and waded out. Splashing and scrubbing, she&#x2019;d laughed, squirted water at him as he stood guard and swapped banter. <br><br>The squishy creature had waited until Shin stepped out on the muddy bank. She&#x2019;d been too busy drying her hair to notice when the thing came wiggling out of the mud. Didn&#x2019;t feel it until it pierced her skin. Had barely had time to look down before it had burrowed into the bottom of her foot. Even as she shrieked it was inching its way under the skin of her ankle and deep into her calf. <br><br>Looking back, he should have amputated her leg at the knee. She&#x2019;d screamed at him not to. Said it would have been a death sen�tence. Pleaded that the thing would probably emerge on its own. That it probably couldn&#x2019;t survive in a human. <br><br>He should have done a lot of things differently. <br><br>That was Donovan. <br><br>A person did a lot of looking back on Donovan. <br><br>Talbot tensed as a strange, piercing whistle sounded from the for�est. Massive trees surrounded Mark&#x2019;s stone outcrop; they rose up in a black wall. Trees on Donovan were like nothing he&#x2019;d seen on Earth. These were giants, four and five hundred feet tall; high over�head the triangular branches interlocked, and the leaves were huge. Walking beneath them was like traveling through an immense cav�ern. And the roots, they were the worst of all. Tarry too long in one spot and they&#x2019;d slither out of the ground, seek to wrap around a foot, ankle or calf. Get caught by the roots and within an hour they would completely engulf a person to the point that not even powered com�bat armor could break free. <br><br>Safety could only be found on one of the stone outcrops. Chunks of bedrock, they jutted up like islands in the ocean of forest. Talbot and Shin had made their way north, traveling from outcrop to out�crop. For whatever reason, the roots avoided solid rock. <br><br>The weird, piercing whistle sounded in the forest again. This was something new. Yet another horror in Donovan&#x2019;s endless parade of terrifying creatures and plants, no doubt. <br><br>For the most part he and Shin had grown used to the sounds, the constant chirring, clicking, singing, and chiming of the wildlife. He didn&#x2019;t know if any of the creatures even had names&#x2014;though some must have been cataloged by Donovan&#x2019;s colonists over the colony&#x2019;s thirty-year existence. <br><br>The house-cat-sized, four-winged fliers were the worst peril, but they couldn&#x2019;t penetrate armor when they swarmed him and Shin. Then there were the sort of dinosaurian bipedal monsters; the smaller clawed creatures; the leechlike sucky things that had burrowed into Shin and slipped out of the mud to try and pierce his armored feet and ankles; and the list went on. Vine-like hanging predators would swing out, only to scrape along his impregnable and slick-sided armor. The firehose-thick snake creatures that whipped sideways to tangle around his feet might not be able to penetrate his protective shell, but they&#x2019;d trip him. And falling was always precarious because of the roots. <br><br>That was another thing about Donovan; the damn plants moved. One way or another, everything on Donovan would try and kill you. As Garcia had found out, and Shin, dear Shin, was even now expe�riencing. <br><br>&#x201c;You all right?&#x201d; he asked, annoyed by the hypocrisy of the salu�tation. <br><br>&#x201c;One of the things is wiggling in my stomach, Mark. I feel . . . like I want to throw up. But it&#x2019;s . . . numb. I&#x2019;m . . . falling, spinning. Endless damn vertigo. God, so . . . sick.&#x201d; <br><br>She&#x2019;d told him that there were several now, eating their way through her body. Either the first had divided, or there had been more than just that one that had gotten under her skin. <br><br>Talbot leaned his head back and imagined himself flying off his solitary stone perch and soaring up, up into the night sky. Burning his way out of the gravity well. Past atmosphere into the vacuum. Then on beyond the orbit of Donovan&#x2019;s moon. Out away from the star they called Capella. Clear out to the inversion point. <br><br>He closed his eyes, let the fantasy possess him as he floated there in space. As if in a trance, he would clap his hands, invert symmetry. Godlike, he&#x2019;d pop out of the universe and navigate his way back the Solar System some thirty light-years distant. <br><br>Home. Blessed, wonderful home. <br><br>What he&#x2019;d give to walk the avenues of Transluna, to peer into the shops, walk into a food stand and eat sausage, donuts, tacos, red beans and rice, Szechuan shrimp, couscous, chocolate cake. Or anything for that matter. Home food. <br><br>But when he opened his eyes, it was to stare up at the alien sky that had become too familiar. No Orion, no Coal Sack, or Big Dip�per. Just the whiter, brighter smear of the Milky Way, and clusters of stars for which he had no names. <br><br>The servos whined in the night as Talbot resettled himself atop the stony outcrop. He checked his charge: barely twenty percent. Come morning he&#x2019;d have to clean the voltaics. Take enough time to let Capella recharge the power pack. Fact was the suits wouldn&#x2019;t take a full charge anymore. <br><br>One of the night creatures flew past in a whisper of wing beats. The dark form blotted the stars as it slowed, circled, and decided he and Shin weren&#x2019;t food. <br><br>Shin made a deep-throated gargling sound, kicked her left leg out, and tensed. He waited out the spasms, then asked, &#x201c;I could end it. Want me to?&#x201d; <br><br>She swallowed hard, kept panting for breath. Had there been light he would have seen the sweat pouring down her round, brown face. The terrified quivering of her eyes as they jerked about in their sockets. <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; She sucked another frantic breath. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t feel a thing below my chest.&#x201d; <br><br>Nothing had prepared them for Donovan. It was one thing to read that the planet was dangerous. Another to have its jaws snapped shut around you. <br><br>&#x201c;We were screwed the moment we lifted off from Port Author�ity,&#x201d; Talbot whispered to the night. <br><br>&#x201c;What the hell were we thinking?&#x201d; Shin asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Garcia&#x2019;s idea.&#x201d; He smiled bitterly. &#x201c;I still remember how he looked at us over the rim of that beer mug in the tavern. &#x2018;Do you really want to space back to Solar System without going out there?&#x2019; Remember, Shin? That look in his eyes?&#x201d; <br><br>She tensed so quickly her armor clattered on the underlying stone. When she finally managed to relax and catch her breath, she said, &#x201c;Yeah. And he was the first to die. Walked under that droopy look�ing tree. With the big floppy leaves and all the weird vines.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And the vine wasn&#x2019;t a vine at all,&#x201d; Talbot finished, remembering how Garcia had tried to bat one of the hanging &#x201c;vines&#x201d; to one side only to have it whip back and shoot into the gap between Garcia&#x2019;s collar and his neck. Even as Garcia screamed he was being lifted. Lifted! Heavy combat armor and all, right up into the tree. <br><br>&#x201c;How did that thing do that?&#x201d; Talbot asked. <br><br>&#x201c;No wonder the Donovanians call it a nightmare,&#x201d; Shin whis�pered. &#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t even get a fix on him up there. Couldn&#x2019;t put him out of his misery.&#x201d; <br><br>Talbot made a face in the night. Word was that a nightmare devoured its victim alive. Sent shoots inside a person&#x2019;s body to slowly digest him from the inside out. Like the things inside Shin&#x2019;s body were doing to her. <br><br>They&#x2019;d flown south from Port Authority in their jury-rigged air�car. Traveled just over six hundred kilometers, deep into the forest beyond the southern extent of the Wind Mountains, and set down in what looked like a clearing in the trees. <br><br>As they leapt out, they&#x2019;d noticed the thick root mat squirming under the aircar. Wiggling roots. Wow. That was new. <br><br>Didn&#x2019;t matter. They&#x2019;d been too busy bragging about being the first humans to ever set foot on that spot. Laughing, staring around at the universe of huge trees rising up to majestic heights around them. Odd trees, with triangular branches, weirdly shaped green, turquoise, teal, and lime-colored leaves. <br><br>Not to mention the noise: a cacophony of singing, clicking, rat�tling harmonics. <br><br>And they&#x2019;d started their circle, clambering over the root mat. They proceeded with their helmets hung on belt clips, sniffing and remarking at the exotic perfumed odors. They carried their rifles at the ready. Each had his heads-up display monitoring for movement, heat signatures, and any threat. <br><br>But damn, the whole place was alive. Flashes of gaudy color flick�ered among the branches as Donovan&#x2019;s peculiar Technicolor crea�tures vanished in pell-mell flight. <br><br>&#x201c;Wish we could go back, Shin. Slap ourselves silly before we jury-rigged that aircar and flew south.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;she sucked a pained breath&#x2014;&#x201c;to be put on report. Scrubbing toilets never . . .&#x201d; Again she tensed and grunted in pain. <br><br>&#x201c;Looked so good?&#x201d; he finished for her. <br><br>He thought back to Garcia. How they had shot futilely up into the branches. If they stepped underneath, the whipping tentacles would try and catch them. And if they stood still, the roots would inexora�bly begin to feel their way up and around their armored feet. And all the while, high in the tree, they could hear Garcia screaming. <br><br>&#x201c;I keep seeing the aircar,&#x201d; Shin said through shallow breaths. &#x201c;Remember, when we got back. It was just a thick ball of roots. What stupid . . .&#x201d; She stiffened, groaned. <br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t believe we left our coms in the aircar,&#x201d; Talbot whispered. &#x201c;What a bunch of fools.&#x201d; <br> <i><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the smart way to do it,&#x201d; </i>Garcia had assured them. <i>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t disobey an order if we&#x2019;re not around where we can hear it, right?&#x201d; </i><br> <i><br>&#x201c;Must have been an equipment malfunction,&#x201d; </i>Shin had joked. <br><br>The massive woody strands had crushed the aircar as if it were a foam cup. <br><br>Mark Talbot stared out at the night, his heart like a leaden anchor in his chest. At least twenty days had passed, and probably more, since he and Shin last heard a shuttle, which meant <i>Turalon </i>had long since spaced for the Solar System. <br><br>As far as Talbot knew, it was just him, Shin, and Donovan. <br><br>God help them. <br><br>The odd rattle in Shin&#x2019;s throat made him turn. &#x201c;Shin?&#x201d; <br><br>Nothing. <br><br>He shifted, raised his thumb light, and flicked it on. Shin&#x2019;s almond eyes were wide, sightless, the pupils fixed. Her mouth hung open, caught in a silent scream. Threads of her black hair shifted with the breeze. <br><br>A mouse-sized bulge appeared under Shin&#x2019;s skin where her neck cleared the armor. Horrified, Talbot watched it make its slow way up and around under her jaw.

Tour.</p><p>So what do you expect from a celebrity autobiography? Tales of an impoverished childhood and an unappreciated early career? Angst-ridden revelation? In Jay Leno&#39;s take on the genre, tales have only one purpose--laughs. This is a book of jokey anecdotes and humorous stories marking the comedian&#39;s progress to the top. The persona of the young Leno is not so different and just as likable as the one appearing nightly on television. Whether it is his mother&#39;s advice, his teachers&#39; complaints, or the awkward situations he finds himself in (for example, standing before an Orthodox Jewish audience who have been mistakenly led to expect a Yiddish storyteller) Leno always sees the funny side.Long before he became the host of the tonight show, Jay Leno was dubbed by the media and his peers alike as the "Hardest-working Man in Show Business." Performing comedy at a breakneck pace, he played more than 300 dates a year and traveled to every corner of the nation. Or as his mother who never quite understood what he did for a living, liked to say, "Going from town to town, putting on his little skits." <p> In <i>Leading with My Chin,</i> Jay recounts many of the ridiculous steps (and missteps) that have led him on maybe the unlikeliest of paths -- from college campuses to Carnegie Hall to Las Vegas, and finally, to <i>The Tonight Show.</i> </p><p> Unlike many comedians whose acts reflect broken homes and neurotic backgrounds, Jay reveals in his wholesome Andover, Massachusetts, upbringing. As the child of a Scottish mother and an Italian father, he had a home life that was equal parts absurd and loving. Which is plain to see in Jay's heartwarming stories about his parents: like the time his mother knocked him out cold with a pot when caught ditching high school. Or the night at Carnegie Hall when she shushed people actually <i>laughing</i> at his show. Or when Jay said to his dad that crushing the roof on the family car wasn't all that bad. </p><p> Out on the comedy circuit -- a virtual battle zone for Jay -- he encountered every humiliation a performer has ever known. From the club owners who didn't pay, to mobsters who spared his life and loaned him their guns, to the agent who wanted him to be America's first comedy wrestler, to the brave and naked strippers who beat up his hecklers for him. Then there were the triumphant performance nights when he was literally mugged on stage, when his clothes were set afire, or when he merely punched out and taunted with death threats. And also that romantic night at the Comedy Store -- working with the likes of David Letterman, Robin Williams, Andy Kaufman and Steve Martin -- when he met his future wife, Mavis, outside the ladies' room! </p><p> In Hollywood, Jay was told that his was a face that would frighten children. He went on to explore every facet of movies and television sitcoms, playing thuggish goofballs, before he finally took to the road and ultimately became what he had always wanted to be: host of <i>The Tonight Show.</i> </p><p> Brimming with stories that are heartwarming and endearing, humiliating and just downright embarrassing, <i>Leading with My Chin</i> demonstrates the silly things you have to go through to make people laugh.</p></p><h2>Gospel According to Saint Mark (Black&#39;s New Testament Commentary)</h2><p>With the author&#39;s own translation of St Mark&#39;s Gospel, this text also contains references to Greek sources.</p><p>Morna D.

Hudson thereafter did all he could to promote the work of a man he admired without reservation, commissioning Lutyens to design the magazine's offices in Covent Garden in 1904, as well as three country houses. <i>Country Life</i> published articles about virtually all his buildings shortly after their completion, recording them as the architect intended, creating an unparalleled visual archive which is the source for this selection of outstanding photographs of Lutyens's domestic architecture. <br><br>Gavin Stamp's authoritative introduction places Lutyens firmly among the giants of architecture: 'an architect of rare genius and humanity'. His selection of twenty-two houses, representative of all the phases of Lutyens's career, illustrates the architect's dual achievements as a renewer of both vernacular tradition and of the Classical language of architecture. Debate continues about Lutyens's place in modern architecture, but his legacy of some of the most inventive and romantic examples of British domestic architecture is unquestionable. <br><br>There are superb examples of his Surrey vernacular style (with its gables, timber, and sweeping planes of tiled roof), such as Fulbrook House-one of his earliest masterpieces; Deanery Garden, designed with the garden in mind for Hudson; early Arts and Crafts houses, such as Goddards and Little Thakeham; his carefully composed Classical houses, such as Heathcote, and his grandest country house of all, Middleton Park, built between the two World Wars. Here, too, are examples of his brilliant enlargements and alterations to existing buildings, such as Lindisfarne Castle, and his creation of the epitome of castle style: Castle Drogo. This pictorial survey culminates in Lutyens's most famous creation: Viceroy's House in New Delhi, one of the greatest buildings in the world. <br><br>Founded in 1897, <i>Country Life</i> from the outset published remarkable photographs, and the huge influence the magazine exerted was nowhere more apparent than in its unprecedented championship of Edwin Lutyens, whose buildings it promoted for almost fifty years. For this book, two hundred photographs have been beautifully reproduced from the <i>Country Life</i> archive and, combined with Gavin Stamp's illuminating essay, provide a unique survey of one of Britain's foremost architects.</p><p><b>Gavin Stamp</b>, born in Bromley four years after Lutyens&#x2019;s death, is an architectural historian and writer.

JoAnn lives in Mill Valley, CAIntroduction:<br> Mosaic design is a fascinating art based on paradoxes that must be embraced. Among these are the pieces, multiple objects of simplicity fused into a singular, complex wholeness; the irregularity that springs from deliberation; and more often than not, the creation that is wrought from destruction. Such paradoxes are put into a singular, complex wholeness; the irregularity that spring from deliberation; and, more often than not, the creation that is wrought from destruction. Such paradoxes are put into context by the mosaicist when the principles of other visual arts are applied. By shaping tesserae like a sculptor, choosing colors like a painter, and weaving patterns like a fiber artist, the mosaicist presents his or her vision.</p><h2>Animals Should Definitely Not Wear Clothing (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Surveying this turbulent history, Paul Mason&#x2019;s <i>Postcapitalism</i> argues that we are on the brink of a change so big and so profound that this time capitalism itself, the immensely complex system within which entire societies function, will mutate into something wholly new.</p><p> At the heart of this change is information technology, a revolution that is driven by capitalism but, with its tendency to push the value of much of what we make toward zero, has the potential to destroy an economy based on markets, wages, and private ownership. Almost unnoticed, in the niches and hollows of the market system, swaths of economic life are beginning to move to a different rhythm. Vast numbers of people are changing how they behave and live, in ways contrary to the current system of state-backed corporate capitalism. And as the terrain changes, new paths open.</p><p> In this bold and prophetic book, Mason shows how, from the ashes of the crisis, we have the chance to create a more socially just and sustainable economy. Although the dangers ahead are profound, he argues that there is cause for hope. This is the first time in human history in which, equipped with an understanding of what is happening around us, we can predict and shape the future.</p></p><p><b>Paul Mason</b> was the award-winning economics editor of Channel 4 News.

While we can see all around us ominous signs of the impasses of global capitalism, it is perhaps more than ever difficult to imagine a feasible alternative to it. How are we to deal with this frustrating situation? Although Mason's book is irresistibly readable, this clarity should not deceive us: it is a book which compels us to think!&#x201d; &#x2015;Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</p></p><h2>The Gilded Tongue: Overly Eloquent Words for Everyday Things</h2><p><b>Join the ranks of the CLERISY</b><p> There are certain qualities that can set you apart from the crowd�like wearing the right clothing, jewelry, or shoes.

Jim continues to travel extensively, performing for children. Erika Oller is well known through her books with Lesl�a Newman and her popular line of gift items featuring happy, rotund ladies.PreSchool-Grade 4 - Pasha is a proud, haughty Russian wolfhound who learns a lesson in humility. Her owner, an accompanist at the Metropolitan Opera House, is excited that the upcoming performance requires a beautiful dog, and Pasha has been chosen for the role. At dress rehearsal, she snubs Sluggo, the other dog who will appear onstage, as he is dressed as a clown. That night, she dreams of being the center of attention, wearing a dazzling red dress and singing to the audience's applause and shouts of "Brava!" On opening night, Pasha gets so caught up in the music that she begins to sing along with the diva. She is unceremoniously dragged off the stage and informed that her operatic career is over. Shamed, Pasha sits in a corner until Sluggo tells her that he thinks she sang beautifully, especially her high notes. She finally realizes that having a friend is much more satisfying than being a star. Soft, expressive watercolors in a variety of sizes add to the gentle humor of the story. Based on an actual event, this tale is an entertaining introduction to the opera. A newspaper article and a letter from the soprano to Pasha's owner are included.

Its title story recounts the story of a reform school cross-country runner who seizes the perfect opportunity to defy the authority that governs his life. It is a pure masterpiece. From there the collection expands even further from the touching &#x201c;On Saturday Afternoon&#x201d; to the rollicking &#x201c;The Decline and Fall and Frankie Buller.&#x201d; Beloved for its lean prose, unforgettable protagonists, and real-life wisdom,<i> The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</i> captured the voice of a generation, and its poignant and empowering life lessons will continue to captivate and entertain readers for generations to come.</p><p>Alan Sillitoe was born in 1928, the son of a tannery worker. He left school at age fourteen to work in a factory. He was one of the working-class novelists who revitalized British fiction in the 1950s. His first novel <i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i> was followed with the bestselling collection <i>The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner</i>. He adapted both works for the screen in the early 1960s. He is the author of more than 40 works of prose, poetry, and drama.As soon as I got to Borstal they made me a long-distance cross-country runner. I suppose they thought I was just the build for it because I was long and skinny for my age (and still am) and in any case I didn't mind it much, to tell you the truth, because running had always been made much of in our family, especially running away from the police. I've always been a good runner, quick and with a big stride as well, the only trouble being that no matter how fast I run, and I did a very fair lick even though I do say so myself, it didn't stop me getting caught by the cops after that bakery job.<br><br>You might think it a bit rare, having long-distance cross-country runners in Borstal, thinking that the first thing a long-distance cross-country runner would do when they set him loose at them fields and woods would be to run as far away from the place as he could get on a bellyful of Borstal slumgullion-but you're wrong, and I'll tell you why. The first thing is that them bastards over us aren't as daft as they most of the time look, and for another thing I'm not so daft as I would look if I tried to make a break for it on my long-distance running, because to abscond and then get caught is nothing but a mug's game, and I'm not falling for it. Cunning is what counts in this life, and even that you've got to use in the slyest way you can; I'm telling you straight: they're cunning, and I'm cunning. If only 'them' and 'us' had the same ideas we'd get on like a house on fire, but they don't see eye to eye with us and we don't see eye to eye with them, so that's how it stands and how it will always stand. The one fact is that all of us are cunning, and because of this there's no love lost between us. So the thing is that they know I won't try to get away from them: they sit there like spiders in that crumbly manor house, perched like jumped-up jackdaws on the roof, watching out over the drives and fields like German generals from the tops of tanks. And even when I jog-trot on behind a wood and they can't see me anymore they know my sweeping-brush head will bob along that hedge-top in an hour's time and that I'll report to the bloke on the gate. Because when on a raw and frosty morning I get up at five 0'clock and stand shivering my belly off on the stone floor and all the rest still have another hour to snooze before the bells go, I slink downstairs through all the corridors to the big outside door with a permit running-card in my :fist, I feel like the first and last man on the world, both at once, if you can believe what I'm trying to say. I feel like the first man because I've hardly got a stitch on and am sent against the frozen fields in a shimmy and shorts-even the first poor bastard dropped on to the earth in midwinter knew how to make a suit of leaves, or how to skin a pterodactyl for a topcoat. But there I am, frozen stiff, with nothing to get me warm except a couple of hours' long-distance running before breakfast, not even a slice of bread-and-sheepdip. They're training me up fine for the big sports day when all the pig-faced snotty-nosed dukes and ladies-who can't add two and two together and would mess themselves like loonies if they didn't have slavies to beck-and-call--come and make speeches to us about sports being just the thing to get us leading an honest life and keep our itching finger-ends off them shop locks and safe handles and hairgrips to open gas meters. They give us a bit of blue ribbon and a cup for a prize after we've shagged ourselves out running or jumping, like race horses, only we don't get so well looked-after as race horses, that's the only thing.<br><br>So there I am, standing in the doorway in shimmy and shorts, not even a dry crust in my guts, looking out at frosty flowers on the ground. I suppose you think this is enough to make me cry? Not likely. Just because I feel like the first bloke in the world wouldn't make me bawl. It makes me feel fifty times better than when I'm cooped up in that dormitory with three hundred others. No, it's sometimes when I stand there feeling like the last man in the world that I don't feel so good. I feel like the last man in the world because I think that all those three hundred sleepers behind me are dead. They sleep so well I think that every scruffy head's kicked the bucket in the night and I'm the only one left, and when I look out into the bushes and frozen ponds I have the feeling that it's going to get colder and colder until everything I can see, meaning my red arms as well, is going to be covered with a thousand miles of ice, all the earth, right up to the sky and over every bit of land and sea. So I try to kick this feeling out and act like I'm the first man on earth. And that makes me feel good, so as soon as I'm steamed up en9ugh to get this feeling in me, I take a flying leap out of the doorway, and off I trot.<br><br>I'm in Essex. It's supposed to be a good Borstal, at least that's what the governor said to me when I got here from Nottingham. u We want to trust you while you are in this establishment," he said, smoothing out his newspaper with lily-white workless hands, while I read the big words upside down: Daily Telegraph. "If you play ball with us, we'll play ball with you." (Honest to God, you'd have thought it was going to be one long tennis match.) H We want hard honest work and we want good athletics,'; he said as well. " And if you give us both these things you can be sure we'll do right by you and send you back into the world an honest man." Well, I could have died laughing, especially when straight after this I hear the barking sergeant-major's voice calling me and two others to attention and marching us off like we was Grenadier Guards. And when the governor kept saying how 4 we' wanted you to do this, and 4 we ' wanted you to do that, I kept looking round for the other blokes, wondering how many of them there was. Of course, I knew there were thousands of them, but as far as I knew only one was in the room. And there are thousands of them, all over the poxeaten country, in shops, offices, railway stations, cars, houses, pubs -In-law blokes like you and them, all on the watch for Outlaw blokes like me and us-and waiting to 'phone for the coppers as soon as we make a false move. And it'll always be there, I'll tell you that now, because I haven't finished making all my false moves yet, and I dare say I won't until I kick the bucket. If the In-laws are hoping to stop me making false moves they're wasting their time. They might as well stand me up against a wall and let fly with a dozen rifles. That's the only way they'll stop me, and a few million others. Because I've been doing a lot of thinking since coming here. They can spy on us all day to see if we're pulling our puddings and if we're working good or doing our 4 athletics' but they can't make an X-ray of our guts to find out what we're telling ourselves. I've been asking myself all sorts of questions, and thinking about my life up to now. And I like doing all this. It's a treat. It passes the time away and don't make Borstal seem half so bad as the boys in our street used to say it was. And this long-distance running lark is 'the best of all, because it makes me think so good that I learn things even better than when I'm on my bed at night. And apart from that, what with thinking so much while I'm running I'm getting to be one of the best runners in the Borstal. I can go my five miles round better than anybody else I know.<br><br>So as soon as I tell myself I'm the :first man ever to be dropped into the world, and as soon as I take that first flying leap out into the frosty grass of an early morning when even birds haven't the heart to whistle, I get to thinking, and that's what I like. I go my rounds in a dream, turning at lane or footpath corners without knowing I'm turning, leaping brooks without knowing they're there, and shouting good morning to the early cow-milker without seeing him. It's a treat, being a long-distance runner. out in the world by yourself with not a soul to make you bad-tempered or tell you what to do or that there's a shop to break and enter a bit back from the next street. Sometimes I think that I've never been so free as during that couple of hours when I'm trotting up the path out of the gates and turning by that bare-faced, big-bellied oak tree at the lane end. Everything's dead, but good, because it's dead before coming alive, not dead after being alive. That's how I look at it. Mind you, I often feel frozen stiff at first. I can't feel my hands or feet or flesh at all, like I'm a ghost who wouldn't know the earth was under him if he didn't see it now and again through the mist. But even though some people would call this frost-pain suffering if they wrote about it to their mams in a letter, I don't, because I know that in half an hour I'm going to be warm, that by the time I get to the main road and am turning on to the wheatfield footpath by the bus stop I'm going to feel as hot as a potbellied stove and as happy as a dog with a tin tail.<br><br>It's a good life, I'm saying to myself, if you don't give in to coppers and Borstal-bosses and the rest of them bastard-faced In-laws. Trot-trot-trot. Puff-puff-puff. Slap-slap-slap go my feet on the hard soil. Swish-swish-swish as my arms and side catch the bare branches of a bush. For I'm seventeen now, and when they let me out of this-if I don't make a break and see that things turn out otherwise-they'll try to get me in the army, and what's the difference between the army and this place I'm in now? They can't kid me, the bastards. I've seen the barracks near where I live, and if there weren't swaddies on guard outside with rifles you wouldn't know the difference between their high walls and the place I'm in now. Even though the swaddies come out at odd times a week for a pint of ale, so what? Don't I come out three mornings a week on my long-distance running, which is fifty times better than boozing. When they first said that I was to do my long-distance running without a guard pedalling beside me on a bike I couldn't believe it; but they called it a progressive and modern place, though they can't kid me because I know it's just like any other Borstal, going by the stories I've heard, except that they let me trot about like this. Borstal's Borstal no matter what they do; but anyway I moaned about it being a bit thick sending me out so early to run five miles on an empty stomach, until they talked me round to thinking it wasn't so bad-which I knew all the time-until they called me a good sport and patted me on the back when I said I'd do it and that I'd try to win them the Borstal Blue Ribbon Prize Cup For Long Distance Cross Country Running (All England). And now the governor talks to me when he comes on his rounds, almost as he'd talk to his prize race horse, if he had one.<br><br>All right, Smith? he asks.<br><br>" Yes, sir," I answer.<br><br>He flicks his grey moustache: How's the running coming along? "<br><br>I've set myself to trot round the grounds after dinner just to keep my hand in, sir," I tell him.<br><br>The pot-bellied pop-eyed bastard gets pleased at this: Good show. I know you'll get us that cup," he says.<br><br>And I swear under my breath: Like boggery, I will." No, I won't get them that cup, even though the stupid tash-twitching bastard has all his hopes in me. Because what does his barmy hope mean? I ask myself. Trot-trot-trot, slap-slap-slap, over the stream and into the wood where it's almost dark and frosty-dew twigs sting my legs. It don't mean a bloody thing to me, only to him, and it means as much to him as it would mean to me if I picked up the racing paper and put my bet on a hoss I didn't know, had never seen, and didn't care a sod if I ever did see. That's what it means to him. And I'll lose that race, because I'm not a race horse at all, and I'll let him know it when I'm about to get out~if I don't sling my hook even before the race. By Christ I will. I'm a human being and I've got thoughts and secrets and bloody life inside me that he doesn't know is there, and he'll never know what's there because he's stupid. I suppose you'll laugh at this, me saying the governor's a stupid bastard when I know hardly how to write and he can read and write and add-up like a professor. But what I say is true right enough. He's stupid, and I'm not, because I can see further into the likes of him than he can see into the likes of me. Admitted, we're both cunning, but I'm more cunning and I'll win in the end even if I die in gaol at eighty-two, because I'll have more fun and fire out of my life than he'll ever get out of his. He's read a thousand books I suppose, and for all I know he might even have written a few, but I know for a dead cert, as sure as I'm sitting here, that what I'm scribbling down is worth a million to what he could ever scribble down. I don't care what anybody says, but that's the truth and can't be denied. I know when he talks to me and I look into his army mug that I'm alive and he's dead.</p><h2>Cul-de-Sac Kids Boxed Set</h2><p>This is an exciting and lighthearted chapter book series for young readers that centers on the often humorous escapades of a group of endearing neighborhood friends.</p><p><b>Beverly Lewis</b> (www.beverlylewis.com), born in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, has more than 17 million books in print.

In <i>Good Life, Good Death</i>, Rinpoche Nawang Gehlek, himself a proclaimed reincarnation of a lama of high stature, passes on some of the accumulated wisdom regarding the Buddhist notion of reincarnation. Whereas many Western teachers of Buddhism shy away from the topic or even deny it, Nawang Gehlek tells us, in very simple language, how reincarnation happens. Even more importantly, he teaches how to prepare for a good death and a good next life. In fact, the largest portion of the book is a primer on eliminating anger and attachment while cultivating patience and awareness. Transforming bad karma to good is the key to a favorable rebirth. Also important is eliminating the role of the ego, and Nawang Gehlek offers nine pithy arguments to "prove the ego wrong." Those looking for a technically detailed account of Tibetan Buddhist reincarnation should look elsewhere, for instance to the various versions of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>. <i>Good Life, Good Death</i> is a short, plainly spoken guide to the reality of dying and the possibility of a good reincarnation. And to this extent, it succeeds admirably. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Rimpoche N. Gehlek was trained by the same teachers who taught the Dalai Lama, and was fully educated in Tibet. He is a favorite speaker at the Omega Institute, the Open Center, and countless spiritual centers around the world. His students cover the full range: Buddhists, Hollywood actors, esteemed composers and musicians.</p><h2>The Little Communist Who Never Smiled</h2><p>An award-winning novel powerfully re-imagines a childhood in the spotlight of history, politics, and destiny. Montreal 1976. A fourteen-year-old girl steps out onto the floor of the Montreal Forum and into history. Twenty seconds on uneven bars is all it takes for Nadia Comaneci, the slight, unsmiling child from Communist Romania, to etch herself into the collective memory. The electronic scoreboard, astonishing spectators with what has happened, shows 1.0. The judges have awarded an unprecedented perfect ten, the first in Olympic gymnastics, though the scoreboard is unable to register anything higher than 9.9. In <i>The Little Communist Who Never Smiled</i>, Lola Lafon tells the story of Comaneci's journey from growing up in rural Romania to her eventual defection to the United States in 1989. Adored by young girls in the west and appropriated as a political emblem by the Ceausescu regime, Comaneci's life was scrutinized wherever she went. Lafon's fictionalized account shows how a single athletic event mesmerizes the world and reverberates across nations.</p><p><b>LOLA LAFON</b>&nbsp;is a bestselling Paris-based novelist and musician. The author of three previous novels, Lafon was born in France and grew up in Sofia and Bucharest. The original French edition of <i>The Little Communist Who Never Smiled</i> won ten prizes. She lives in Paris."One of my favorite novels of the year ... a metafictional biography tracing Comaneci's life from her relentless formation by Bela Karoli into the first gymnast to earn a perfect 10, at the ripe old age of fourteen, to her defection to the United States days before the Ceausescu regime collapsed, is a brilliant blend of fact, invention, and creative historiography. Lafon was raised by French parents in Ceausescu's Romania; her observations on the hypocrisies of both capitalism and Communism when it comes to sport, and to the lives of women, are sharp and unsparing. This is a fiercely feminist novel. It's compulsively readable, too, with descriptions of feats of physical daring to stop your heart." --Alexandra Schwartz, NewYorker.com<br><br>"In <i>The Little Communist Who Never Smiled</i>, French writer Lola Lafon considers a less common perspective &#x2013; the female body as an ideological battleground. The result is enthralling &#x2013; a thought-provoking, surprisingly touching story about a little girl who shook up the world." --The Big Issue (UK)</p><h2>Benjy Goes to a Resturant and Pa</h2><p>A little boy describes his experiences eating in a restaurant with his mother and father.</p><p>ea. vol: photogs. by author. unpaged. CIP. Crown. Mar. 1986. BD $3.95. PreS Each of these attractive board books tells the story of a big event in a toddler's life. Benjy Goes to a Restaurant as a special treat. He and his parents order, and then they watch the chef as he cooks. When Benjy's spaghetti is served, he tries to use his fork but finds using his fingers is easier; one photo shows him literally wearing his meal. Taryn Goes to the Dentist for the first time. Everything is explained in terms that a two year old will understand. Taryn's mother is present in nearly all the photos, and everyone is smiling and relaxed. At home, Taryn shares everything she learned with her daddy, her baby sister and her doll. Both books have stunning full-color photographs and a pleasing layout. These subjects are seldom dealt with in books for the very youngest; the photo-essay approach makes it easy for toddlers to relate to the experiences. Taryn's story in particular would be useful as an introduction to a potentially unpleasant experience. A note of caution: children not living in large cities might experience culture shock when visiting the dentist or dining out after looking at these books.
